  # This configuration enables what's referred to as "Author Mode". In this
  # "mode", the local working copy is used to build the documentation. It
  # doesn't refer to a specific branch, whether local or remote. This avoids
  # generating only static assets, but no documentation. 
  # For more information, see https://docs.antora.org/antora/1.0/playbook/author-mode/. 
  # Normally, you would add standard content sources here. For more information
  # about them, see https://docs.antora.org/antora/1.0/playbook/configure-content-sources/.
