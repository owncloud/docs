# ownCloud Documentation (v2)

This project is a port of the ownCloud documentation, that was previously generated using [Sphinx-Doc](http://www.sphinx-doc.org), to [Antora](./docs/what-is-antora.md).
Fundamentally, not that much has changed.

All of the same information is still available.
However, here's what has changed:

1. The platform (and tools) used to build the documentation, which is [Antora](./docs/what-is-antora.md).
2. The file format that the documentation is written in, which is [AsciiDoc](./docs/what-is-asciidoc.md).
3. The <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> & <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> of the documentation

## Contributing to the Documentation

To get started contributing to the documentation, please refer to [the Getting Started Guide](./docs/getting-started.md).

## Generating the Documentation

To generate the documentation, whether in HTML or PDF format, please refer to [the Building the Documentation guide](./docs/build-the-docs.md).

## Common Content and Styling the Documentation

If you want to change eg. a footer, want to suggest an improvement of the layout or find a bug in the look and feel of the ownCloud documentation, you can find all the information that you need in [the docs-ui repository](https://github.com/owncloud/docs-ui/blob/master/README.adoc).
Changes made in ``docs-ui`` are valid for the whole documentation.
