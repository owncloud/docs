# ownCloud Documentation

[![Build Status](http://drone.owncloud.com/api/badges/owncloud/docs/status.svg)](http://drone.owncloud.com/owncloud/docs)

This project is a port of the ownCloud documentation, that was previously generated using [Sphinx-Doc](http://www.sphinx-doc.org), to [Antora](./docs/what-is-antora.md).
Fundamentally, not that much has changed.

All of the same information is still available.
However, here's what has changed:

1. The platform (and tools) used to build the documentation, which is [Antora](./docs/what-is-antora.md).
2. The file format that the documentation is written in, which is [AsciiDoc](./docs/what-is-asciidoc.md).
3. The <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> & <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> of the documentation

## Contributing to the Documentation

## Generating the Documentation

To generate the documentation, whether in HTML or PDF format, please refer to the [Building the Documentation guide](./docs/build-the-docs.md).

## Common Content and Styling the Documentation

If you want to suggest an improvement to the ownCloud documentation theme, such as the layout, the header or the footer text, or if you find a bug, all the information that you need is in the `docs-ui` repository.
Changes made in `docs-ui` are valid for the whole documentation.

Please read how to test un-merged [docs-ui](./docs/test-ui-bundle.md) changes with content from the ownCloud documentation.
