## Common Content and Styling the Documentation

If you want to suggest an improvement to the ownCloud documentation theme, such as the layout, the header or the footer text, or if you find a bug, all the information that you need is in the `docs-ui` repository. Changes made in `docs-ui` are valid for the whole documentation.

Please read how to test un-merged [docs-ui](./docs/test-ui-bundle.md) changes with content from the ownCloud documentation.

## Best Practices and Tips

Refer to [Best Practices and Tips for writing in AsciiDoc](./docs/best-practices.md) for more information.

## Target Branch and Backporting

Please always do your changes in `master` and backport them to the relevant branches.
The **ONLY** reason for doing a PR in a branch directly is, to fix an issue which is
_only_ present in that particular branch! When creating a PR and it is necessary to backport,
document in the PR to which branches a backport is needed.

When backporting, consider using the [backport script](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/developer_manual/general/backporting.html)
which eases life a lot and speeds up the process. It is also very benificial when using the
extended code provided, because a clear naming structure of the backport PR is generated automatically.

## When Does a Change Get Published to the Docs Web Site?

Changes made will get published to the web under the following conditions:

1. A nightly running drone job pulls the documentation from the Client, IOS and Android repo.
This pull will also be used for any builds triggered by the scenarios outlined below. This means for changes made in one of these
repos, a merge to master or one of the used branches in docs the next day is necessary to get them published.
2. A merge to one of the defined version branches triggers as a last step a master branch build.
3. A merge to master triggers a site build which then pushes all versions defined in site.yml.

## Create a New Version Branch for Docs

Please refer to [Create a New Version Branch for Docs](./docs/new-version-branch.md) for more information.
