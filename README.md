## Antora Site Structure for Docs

Refer to the [Antora Site Structure for Docs](./docs/antora-site-structure.md) for more information. 

## Documentation Guidelines

Refer to the [Documentation Guidelines](./docs/doc-guidelines.md) for more information about backgrounds and processes.

## Contributing to the Documentation

To get started contributing to the documentation, please refer to the [Getting Started Guide](./docs/getting-started.md).

With regard to language and style issues, consult the [Style Guide](./docs/style-guide.md).

## Generating the Documentation

To generate and view the documentation locally or planning major changes, refer to the [Building the Documentation guide](./docs/build-the-docs.md).

## Common Content and Styling the Documentation

If you want to suggest an improvement to the ownCloud documentation theme, such as the layout, the header or the footer text, or if you find a bug, all the information that you need is in the `docs-ui` repository. Changes made in `docs-ui` are valid for the whole documentation.

Please read how to test un-merged [docs-ui](./docs/test-ui-bundle.md) changes with content from the ownCloud documentation.

## Best Practices and Tips

Refer to [Best Practices and Tips for writing in AsciiDoc](./docs/best-practices.md) for more information.

To check for broken links manually, see [install and use a broken-link-checker](./docs/checking-broken-links.md).

## Target Branch and Backporting

Please always do your changes in `master` and backport them to the relevant branches.
The **ONLY** reason for doing a PR in a branch directly is, to fix an issue which is
_only_ present in that particular branch! When creating a PR and it is necessary to backport,
document in the PR to which branches a backport is needed.

When backporting, consider using the [backport script](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/developer_manual/general/backporting.html)
which eases life a lot and speeds up the process. It is also very benificial when using the
extended code provided, because a clear naming structure of the backport PR is generated automatically.

## When Does a Change Get Published to the Docs Web Site?

Changes made will get published to the web under the following conditions:

1. A merge in a component to one of the defined version branches triggers as a last step a master branch build.
2. A merge to master triggers a site build which then pushes all versions defined in site.yml.

## Create a New Version Branch for Docs

Please refer to [Create a New Version Branch for Docs](./docs/new-version-branch.md) for more information.

## HTML to PDF

The script `bin/ownCloudDocPdf.py`, temporarily necessary until Antora is upgraded to Version 3, allows users to convert a sequence of web pages to the PDF format. It navigates through pages of a manual by following a "next" link on each page and converts each page to a PDF. The PDFs are then merged into a single PDF file for further use. Note that this script has a chance to miss pages as it is based on continuous chains of "next" links compared to Antora generated pdf which accesses a full content catalogue.

### How to Use

The script requires Python to be installed and some libraries provided by th OS and is executed from the command line. It accepts a URL as an argument.

```bash
python bin/ownCloudDocPdf.py [URL]
```

### Example

```python
python bin/ownCloudDocPdf.py https://doc.owncloud.com/webui/next/classic_ui/
```

### Dependencies

- `Python (Script developed and tested with version 3.10)`
- `wkhtmltopdf`
- `pdftk`
- `requests`

### Installing Dependencies

Install the Python requests library:

```bash
python -m pip install requests
```
On Debian-based systems, install `wkhtmltopdf` and `pdftk` using:

```bash
sudo apt-get install wkhtmltopdf pdftk
```
On other systems, please refer to the documentation for `wkhtmltopdf` and `pdftk` for installation instructions.

**Output**
The script will output a PDF file named output.pdf in the current directory. If a file with that name already exists, the script will increment a number in parentheses until it finds an unused filename (like output(1).pdf, output(2).pdf, etc.).

**Notes**
The temporary PDF files generated for each page are stored under /tmp/ and are deleted after the final PDF is merged.
Ensure that you have write permissions in the directory where the script is run, as it will attempt to save the output PDF in that location.
