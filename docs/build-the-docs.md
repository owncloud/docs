# Building the Documentation

You're now ready to build (generate) the ownCloud documentation.
The documentation can be generated in HTML and PDF formats.

## Generating HTML Documentation

There are two ways to generate the documentation in HTML format:

- Using the Official Docker Container
- Running Antora from the Command-Line

### Using the Docker Container

To build the documentation using the Docker container, from the command line, in the root of the docs directory, run the following command:

```
docker run -ti --rm \
    -e DOCSEARCH_ENABLED=true \
    -e DOCSEARCH_ENGINE=lunr \
    -v $(pwd):/antora/ \
    -w /antora/ \
    antora:custom \
      --cache-dir /antora/cache/ \
      --redirect-facility nginx \
      --generator ./generators/search \
      --stacktrace \
      site.yml
```

This command:

- Starts up [ownCloud's custom Antora Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/antora/antora/)
- Removes any existing documentation
- Runs Antora's `generate` command, which regenerates the documentation

If all goes well, you will _not_ see any console output.
If a copy of the container doesn't exist locally, you can pull down a copy, by running `docker pull antora/antora`.
Otherwise, you should see output similar to the following:

```console
Unable to find image 'antora/antora:1.0.1' locally
1.0.1: Pulling from antora/antora
605ce1bd3f31: Already exists
0511902e1bcd: Downloading  5.347MB/19.61MB

1e0ba8eb567c: Downloading  4.569MB/37.51MB
d5a49762c0f9: Download complete
```

### Using the Antora Tools On The Command-Line

**Note:** The environment variables at the beginning are required for building the docs with integrated site search.
```
DOCSEARCH_ENABLED=true DOCSEARCH_ENGINE=lunr \
antora --clean --pull \
    --cache-dir ./cache/ \
    --redirect-facility nginx \
    --generator ./generators/search \
    --stacktrace \
    site.yml
```

### Update The Generated Search Index

The playbook file (`site.yml`) sets the `site.url` configuration directive to `http://localhost:5000`.
It's likely fair to assume that this isn't the domain where the documentation will be hosted.

Using `sed`, such as in the following example, from the root directory of the project should suffice.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e
sed -i 's/localhost:5000/<hosted domain and port>/g' public/search_index.json
```

### Viewing The HTML Documentation

Assuming that there are no errors, the next thing to do is to view the result in your browser.
In case you have already installed a webserver, you need to make the html docmentation
available pointing to subdirectory `public`
or for easy handling use the [NPM Serve tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) so that you can view your changes,
before committing and pushing the changes to the remote docs repository.
You could also use [PHP's built-in webserver](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php) as well.

The following example uses *Serve*, to start it run the following command in the root of your docs repository:

```
serve public &
```

This starts Serve and set it running in the background, using the `public` directory, (re)generated by `antora site.yml`, as the document root, listening on `http://localhost:5000`.
_The URL is automatically copied to the clipboard._

![Viewing the Antora docs with NPM serve](./images/viewing-the-antora-docs-with-npm-serve.png)

Open the URL in your browser of choice and you'll see two links, as below.

![The initial page in the local copy of the Antora-generated documentation](./images/antora-initial-local-page.png)

Click "**server/**", and you'll see the local copy of the documentation.

![Viewing the locally generated Antora documentation](./images/viewing-the-locally-generated-antora-documentation.png)

If you're happy with your changes, as with any other change, create a set of meaningful commits and push them to the remote repository.
If you're _not_ satisfied with the changes, however, continue to make further updates, as necessary, and run `antora site.yml` afterwards.
Your changes will be reflected in the local version of the site that Serve is rendering.

We hope that you can see that contributing to the documentation using Antora is a pretty straight-forward process, and not _that_ demanding.

## Generating PDF Documentation

To generate the documentation in PDF format, you need to have `asciidoctor-pdf` and GNU `make` installed, as PDF generation isn't, _yet_, supported by Antora.
To install asciidoctor-pdf, please refer to [the official installation instructions](https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-pdf/).
To install GNU Make, please refer to the link below for your operating system:

- [Linux](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-installing-gnu-c-compiler-development-environment-on-ubuntu/)
- [macOS](http://brewformulas.org/Make)
- [Microsoft Windows](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/install.html)

When installed, run the command below in the root directory of the repository, to generate PDF versions of the _administration_, _developer_ and _user_ manuals.

```console
make pdf
```

`make pdf` invokes [asciidoctor-pdf](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf) and passes it:

1. **The configuration file to use**

    This configuration file, based on [the asciidoctor-pdf theming guide](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf/blob/master/docs/theming-guide.adoc), contains all the essential details required to build a PDF version of one of the manuals.

    This includes the list of files to use as the PDF's source material as well as the required YAML front-matter. The front-matter includes details such as whether to render a table of contents, the icon set to use, and the images base directory.

2. **The custom theme directory and the custom theme file**

    This ensures that the defaults are overridden, where relevant, to ensure that the generated PDF is as close to the current ownCloud style as possible.

When generated, the PDF files will be generated in the build directory (`build`), and will be named after the respective manual.
The build directory is called `build` and is located in the root of the repository.

## Viewing Build Errors

If an aspect of your change contains invalid AsciiDoc, then you'll see output similar to the example below.

```console
asciidoctor: ERROR: index.adoc: line 25: only book doctypes can contain level 0 sections
```

There, you can see:

- That an error was found
- The file it was found in
- The line of that file where it is located
