# Style Guide

With regard to English, many things are optional, and style certainly is subjective. This style guide should help all contributors write professionally and consistently. This is a work in progress and will be adjusted as questions arise or suggestions are made.


## Basic Writing Rules

- American English is used for all ownCloud documentation, therefore use customize instead of customise, behavior instead of behaviour, etc.

- Don't use 'please'. No need to beg the reader to do something that is necessary to achieve a certain goal.

- Contractions as in "don't" are okay to use.

- Avoid writing "in order to" because "to" says it all.


## Use of Lower and Upper Case Letters:

- For headlines, we adhere to the rules of the Chicago Manual of Style. When unsure, use the following tool and select "Do Not Capitalize Words Based on Length":

- When referring to a figure or table in the surrounding text, capitalize Figure 2 or Table 1.


## Punctuation:

Some basic punctuation rules in English:

- If a sentence starts with a subordinate clause (like this one does), a comma needs to be set before the main clause starts. Just like in German.

- A main clause (like this one) is followed by a subordinate clause without a comma although in German a comma would be set before the 'although' in this sentence. Simple examples:

When yada happens, you need to use a comma.

Use no comma if dada happens.

- We don't use serial (Oxford) commas in a series of three and more. They are fancy but serve no purpose. Here are examples of serial commas we do NOT want to use, thus placed in []:

Click on the icon, select the desired item from the drop-down menu[,] and click on it.

The icons, the menu[,] and the tool bar are three navigation elements, but don't need a comma before "and".

- As a rule of thumb: you don't need commas before "and", except in rare cases when two main clauses are connected by "and": The banana icon is yellow, and the cucumber icon is green. Other coordinating conjunctions are 'but, or, so, yet'.

If you wonder whether commas are really that important, they can actually change the meaning of a sentence if only in rare cases. Look at the following example with and without the second comma:

A panda enters a bar, eats[,] shoots and leaves.

The comma decides whether the panda eats bamboo shoots or shoots  firearms.


## Hyphenated Words

In English, composite terms are rarely hyphenated except for adjectives.
Some nouns have become one word over time:

username

cellphone

...

- Never use drop-down-menu or pop-up-window, instead it's drop-down menu and pop-up window.

- Using a hyphen is the regular spelling for composite adjectives: right-hand side, four-year-old computer.

## Acronyms:

At first mention, use the full term with the acronym in parenthesis. Some examples: ownCloud Infinite Scale (oCIS) or Internet Content Adaptation Protocol (ICAP). Afterward you can simply use oCIS and ICAP. This rule can be neglected with widely known acronyms like IBM, AMD, etc.

## List of words often spelled wrong:

email (not e-mail)

[to be extended]

## Document Structure

For app or service installations, the following structure is recommended. Keep these headers level 2 and the table of contents limited to those.
