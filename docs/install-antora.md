# Install Antora

Installing Antora on your local development (virtual) machine doesn't take *too* much time, based on whether you install the tools directly, or use the official Antora Docker container.

**Please note:** if you just want to make text changes, then installing [the AsciiDoc Live Preview Plugin](https://asciidoctor.org/docs/editing-asciidoc-with-live-preview/), whether as a Browser plugin, or as part of your text editor or IDE, may be sufficient for your needs.

## Use The Docker Container

If you’re looking for the simplest path to making Antora available, so that you can build the documentation and preview the documentation locally then, assuming that you have Docker already installed, run the following two commands.

```console
# Install the Antora Docker container in your local Docker registry.
docker pull antora/antora

# Install NPM’s serve command, which is an easy way of serving static content.
yarn global add serve
```

After the commands finishes executing, you’re ready to [build the documentation](./build-the-docs.md).
You can find out more about *Serve* in [the official NPM documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve#usage).

## Install The Antora Tools Locally

To install all the Antora tools on your local machine will take a little bit of time and effort.
Before you get started, make sure that your development machine is one of [the supported hardware platforms](https://docs.antora.org/antora/1.0/supported-platforms/#platforms).

After that, install the system requirements for your platform, whether that's [Linux](https://docs.antora.org/antora/1.0/install/linux-requirements/), [macOS](https://docs.antora.org/antora/1.0/install/macos-requirements/), or [Microsoft Windows](https://docs.antora.org/antora/1.0/install/windows-requirements/).
These include the base build tools, Node 8, and NVM.

With that done, you're now ready to install Antora's two command-line tools; these are the Antora CLI and the default Antora site generator.

To install the Antora CLI, run the command: `npm i -g @antora/cli`.
You can then test that it's installed by running the command: `antora -v`.

To install the default Antora site generator, run the command: `npm i -g @antora/site-generator-default`.
This command installs it globally.
If you want to install it locally, remove the `-g` switch.

With the dependencies and Antora tools installed, you’re ready to [build the documentation](./build-the-docs.md) locally.
