# Create a New Version Branch for Docs

In general, the docs branch itself does not have versioning, but some doc repos have. If a doc repo has versioning, it impacts of course this repo but usually only in the way to set version attribute values correctly. For details see the corresponding _Create a New Version Branch_ document of the sourcing doc repo.
