== What is ownCloud Server

ownCloud Server is an open source *LAMP-stack-based* server application that allows you to access your files from anywhere in a secure way. The files are stored on a server running ownCloud. You can access your files via the browser or sync them to your desktop or mobile device like you might know it from oneDrive, Dropbox or others. The difference with ownCloud is that you stay in control of your data as you can install ownCloud in your own environment.

== What is Infinite Scale

Infinite Scale is a *cloud-native microservices-based architecture* and the latest generation of server applications. It does not depend on external software packages like PHP or a database which eliminates all the hassle that comes along with using them. With its modern xref:{latest-ocis-version}@ocis:ROOT:architecture/architecture.adoc[architecture], Infinite Scale provides all xref:{latest-ocis-version}@ocis:ROOT:availability_scaling/availability_scaling.adoc[deployment models] for cloud infrastructure deployments and optimized scaling setups for the best output in return for the invested energy. With the single binary concept, managing the server is much more streamlined over all deployment methods.

With all the measures taken, *security is greatly increased* compared to a LAMP stack. For details read the page about xref:{latest-ocis-version}@ocis:ROOT:security/security.adoc[Security Aspects of Infinite Scale].

Amongst many other features, the most notable benefits of ownCloud Infinite Scale are:

=== Spaces

Spaces are special folders made for teamwork. 

Members of a space enjoy the service of a space manager, who takes care of enough quota and the right people added to a space. Thus a space is the ideal place where school classes, co-workers in business projects or other working groups collaborate. Spaces don't "belong" to individual people, but are assigned to someone with the role of the space manager. For example, school classes can easily be handed over to the next teacher or organizations can transfer project responsibilities if an employee leaves the organization.

Usually space managers are, for example, project leaders or teachers. 
All in all, spaces make life easier for admins by giving space managers the ability of self-service.

=== ownCloud Web

ownCloud Web is bundled with Infinite Scale, has a new design and comes with a brand new look. The goal is to make ownCloud accessible to all people from children to experts. Technically, ownCloud Web is built with VueJS as dedicated client, communicating via well-formed APIs with the Infinite Scale server, just like all the other ownCloud clients. ownCloud Web can be used as app for ownCloud Server but is limited in its capabilities. Nevertheless, switching to ownCloud Web makes a future migration to Infinite Scale easier for users as they are already used to the new UI. ownCloud Web can be customized according to your corporate identity via config values.

=== Collaborative Editing

Editing with Microsoft Online Office 365, Collabora Office and OnlyOffice 

Infinite Scale comes with a ramped-up WOPI protocol server that provides collaborative office document editing with multiple users. It supports Microsoft Online Office 365, Collabora Office and OnlyOffice out of the box and is ready to support more collaborative editors in the near future. With the focus on seamless collaboration, files are locked when opened in an online editor to show others that they are in use and likely to change.

=== Links

In Infinite Scale, we drastically simplified sharing by links. First of all: You can get a link with a single click in ownCloud Web. Second: You can share one and the same link with internal and external people at once and if you change your mind, you can restrict access for example to only internal people of your organization. This feature was known as "private link" in ownCloud 10 and is still available but via the "internal" selection of a link.

=== Cloud Native Deployments

Infinite Scale is a platform built of independent microservices that communicate over the highly efficient gRPC  protocol internally and provide HTTP APIs externally. That gives the flexibility for easy extension, integration and deployment of the entire platform.

For the sake of efficiency, Infinite Scale reduces dependencies and works without a traditional database. This saves administration efforts, hardware resources, attack vectors and energy.

One of the biggest benefits of Infinite Scale is the variety of xref:{latest-ocis-version}@ocis:ROOT:deployment/index.adoc[deployment models] that make the rollout of the platform really easy and independent of the underlying infrastructure as much as possible.

Infinite Scale can be delivered as a xref:{latest-ocis-version}@ocis:ROOT:deployment/binary/binary-setup.adoc[single binary] - which is a self-contained, complete and ready to start compilation of all microservices that are needed to simply start Infinite Scale. Other featured deployment methods are xref:{latest-ocis-version}@ocis:ROOT:deployment/container/container-setup.adoc[docker images] and xref:{latest-ocis-version}@ocis:ROOT:deployment/container/orchestration/orchestration.adoc#docker-compose[docker-compose] files. For setups with scaling requirements all Infinite Scale microservices can be deployed and scaled separately on orchestration infrastructure like xref:{latest-ocis-version}@ocis:ROOT:deployment/container/orchestration/orchestration.adoc#kubernetes-and-helm[Kubernetes].

With that, Infinite Scale provides all deployment models for modern cloud infrastructure deployments and optimized scaling setups to achieve the best output in return for the invested energy. 

=== ownCloud Desktop App

Starting with version 3.2, the ownCloud Desktop app is fully compatible with Infinite Scale as well as the recent ownCloud Server.

For Infinite Scale, the new desktop sync app supports the Infinite Scale spaces concept for modern collaboration. Users can select which spaces they are interested in and synchronize these to their desktops. This is supported by a UI where spaces can be selected comfortably, which results in individual and efficient sync connections for each space.

The new desktop app also comes with many performance improvements as well as improvements for Windows VFS, improved log file generation and a large number of other bug fixes. 

=== ownCloud Android App

Starting with the new Android app version 4.0, users get full support for Infinite Scale spaces as well as the recent ownCloud Server. Users have comfortable access to the collaboration spaces in all their accounts on their mobile devices. The list of spaces available is dynamically retrieved from the Infinite Scale server and listed along with the cover image and description. 

The Android app is an example of how efficient data management works on the mobile platform with Infinite Scale.

=== ownCloud iOS App

Starting with the new iOS app version 12, users get full support for Infinite Scale, including spaces,  as well as the recent ownCloud Server. Users can comfortably access the collaboration spaces in all their accounts on their mobile devices. The list of spaces available is dynamically retrieved from the Infinite Scale server and listed along with the cover image and description. 

The iOS app is an example of how efficient data management works on the mobile platform with Infinite Scale.

=== Notes on Native Client Support for Spaces

The latest Infinite Scale features are supported since ownCloud Desktop release 3.0.

The iOS and Android apps currently only support the home space.

On the iOS platform, the team is preparing the big 12.0 release which will fully support spaces. It is available in our https://owncloud.com/beta-testing/#ios[public TestFlight beta program].
