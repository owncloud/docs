== Infinite Scale 5.0.0

[discrete]
=== General

This release brings significant enhancements in performance and stabilit. It is also designed to provide an optimized experience for both end users and administrators. Please find the most important changes described here or refer to the changelog for a complete list of changes:

* Infinite Scale: https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/releases/tag/v5.0.0[Changes in 5.0.0]
* Web: https://github.com/owncloud/web/releases/tag/v8.0.0[Changelog for ownCloud Web 8.0.0]

[discrete]
=== Federated Cloud Sharing (Feature Preview)

Federated Cloud Sharing allows users to access and collaborate on files stored on connected external servers, as if they were stored on the user's instance. This creates a fluid and efficient workflow, eliminating the need for multiple file versions or complex file transfer processes. With Federated Cloud Sharing data can reside on its original server, ensuring compliance with regional data sovereignty laws and organizational data policies.

To enable file sharing with a user on a different, connected server, an initial invitation needs to be sent. Once this is completed, files can be shared with that user as usual by entering their username, just like with internal users. The only difference is that users from connected instances will be marked as `Federated Users` for easy identification and management.

*Technical Note:* +
Federated Cloud Sharing in Infinite Scale is based on the Open Cloud Mesh protocol version 1.1 (OCM 1.1) https://cs3org.github.io/OCM-API/docs.html?branch=v1.1.0&repo=OCM-API&user=cs3org#/paths/~1shares/post[Learn more about OCM 1.1]

Kudos to all members of the CS3-Community who contributed to this project. A special thanks is owed to CERN for their contribution of the Science Mesh App. Thank You!

=== Password Policy for Sharing Links

The Password Policy for Sharing Links allows administrators to set specific requirements for password strength. This feature ensures that your sharing practices align seamlessly with existing security policies.

The customizable settings for the password are minimum amount of:

* uppercase characters
* lowercase characters
* numbers
* the special characters: "!#\$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~
* and password length

**Banned Passwords List** +
To further bolster security, this update includes the ability to define a banned password list. This feature prevents users from using overly common or simplistic passwords, like `Password123!`, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

**Integrated Password Generator** +
Accompanying this new password policy is a built-in password generator. It automatically creates passwords that comply with your defined requirements, simplifying the process for users while maintaining a high standard of security.

[discrete]
=== Default Link Permission

With this new capability we've introduced a new configuration option that allows administrators to set the default permissions for sharing links. This feature is tailored to meet the varying security needs of different organizations.

As an administrator, you now have the flexibility to define what the standard permissions for a link should be. This means you can choose whether to create a sharing link that is accessible to external parties with just a click, or opt for a more secure link that requires user authentication for access.

The default link permissions is communicated through capabilities. The default setting for this config option is set to `default_link_permissions:1`, meaning that by default, anyone can access the link with viewer permissions. This enhancement is geared towards providing administrators with greater control over their organizations data sharing and security protocols.

[discrete]
=== Simplified Shared with me Page

We made significant improvements to the `Shared with me` section to make your file-sharing experience more efficient and user-friendly.

Previously divided into three parts, the `Shared with me` section has now been consolidated into a single, simplified section. This change provides a more streamlined view of all shared files, making it easier to navigate and manage your shared content.

[discrete]
==== Auto-Accept Feature for Shares:

In an effort to simplify your workflow, we have implemented an auto-accept feature for shares which is enabled per default. This means that any files shared with you will automatically appear in your `Shared with me` section without the need for manual acceptance, saving you time and effort.

[discrete]
==== Filter by People:

If you remember only the name of the person who shared a file with you, our new filter option comes to the rescue. You can now filter the shares by the name of people, making it easier to find files shared by specific individuals.

[discrete]
==== Option to Hide Unwanted Shares:

We understand that sometimes you may receive shares that are not relevant or wanted. To address this, we have introduced a feature that allows you to hide such shares. By hiding a share, you can maintain a clear view of the shares that are important to you, ensuring your `Shared with me` section remains organized and clutter-free.

**Access to Hidden Shares:** +
If you change your mind and wish to view a hidden share, you can easily do so. A dedicated area for hidden shares has been added, allowing you to revisit and manage any shares you have previously hidden.

[discrete]
==== Enhanced Search Filter:

To help you quickly find specific shares, we have improved the search functionality within the `Shared with me` section. This enhanced search filter enables you to efficiently locate files based on various criteria.

[discrete]
==== Sync Feature for Better Control:

Gain control over which shared files are available for sync on your mobile and desktop devices. This feature is especially useful for managing large files. You can now choose to exclude certain files from syncing right from the start.

[discrete]
=== Shortcuts

This new feature is designed to improve navigation and access within the platform, making your experience more efficient and integrated. Creating shortcuts is a new option in the 'New' menu, where you can also create new files.

**Link to External: Webpage:** +
You can now create shortcuts that link directly to external websites. This feature allows for quick access to frequently used online resources, right from within ownCloud Infinite Scale.

**Internal Linking to File, Folder or a Space** +
The Shortcut feature also allows you to create links to internal files, folders, or Spaces. This improves organization and accessibility to important documents and areas within ownCloud, which is especially useful in collaborative scenarios.

[discrete]
=== Improved Tags

You can now add tags to files directly from the files details panel in the right sidebar. This update eliminates the need to navigate away from the details panel, streamlining the process of organizing and categorizing your documents. With tagging now integrated into the details panel, the process becomes more intuitive and user-friendly.

[discrete]
=== New action: Duplicate a Space

This action is designed to enhance the flexibility and efficiency of space management for our users. You now have the option to create a copy of an existing Space. This duplication includes all files and folder structures within the Space. The duplicated Space will be free of any existing members, shares, sharing links or tags. This precaution is taken to prevent accidental data leakage and to ensure that the Space Manager can start from scratch, setting up a new Space for team collaboration as needed. This feature saves time and effort in setting up new Spaces that require similar content and structure to existing ones, but with different sharing.

[discrete]
=== Show WebDAV Path

Advanced users now have the ability to view the WebDav Path and URL for each file, folder or Space. This is particularly beneficial for users who prefer to interact through alternative methods, such as command-line interfaces or other third-party tools that support WebDav. It offers a direct and powerful way to interact with resources, especially for scripting, automation, or programmatic access.

[discrete]
=== Realtime Events (Server Sent Events)

This new feature brings the ability to display events in real-time, a shift from the traditional time series (polling mechanism). This advancement is made possible through the implementation of Server Sent Events (SSE). By leveraging SSE, Infinite Scale now provides an instantaneous update mechanism. This means that events like notifications and file locking status changes are communicated to users in real-time.

**Real-Time Notifications:** +
You will receive notifications instantly ensuring that you don't have to wait for important information.

**Immediate File Locking Visibility:** +
The status of file locking and unlocking is now displayed in real-time. This feature is crucial for collaborative environments, as it allows team members to see when a file is being used or becomes available, preventing conflicts and enhancing collaboration efficiency.

[discrete]
=== Keyword Query Language (KQL)

To streamline and enhance the development process, we have standardized the search syntax across server-client search requests using the Keyword Query Language (KQL). By adopting KQL, a well-known and widely used standard, we significantly simplify the development process for client applications. Developers can now rely on a familiar syntax, reducing complexity and accelerating development.

[discrete]
=== NATS.js as Registry

To enhance the robustness of Infinite Scale we integrated NATS.js as our primary registry mechanism. This update is particularly beneficial for large-scale deployments. With NATS.js, Infinite Scale is better equipped to handle large-scale deployments efficiently. NATS.js facilitates smoother and more stable operations even as the number of services and nodes increases. The goal is to provide a resilient and fault-tolerant framework, ensuring continuous and uninterrupted service even in demanding scenarios.

[discrete]
=== Web Embed Mode

The Web UI now provides an Embed Mode for easier integration into other applications. The Embed Mode allows external applications to integrate the Web UI directly. This means that users can now access and interact with Infinite Scale within the context of other applications.

Example: Imagine you're using a chat application and want to send a sharing link. With the Embed Mode, you can open the Web UI in a file picker-like interface, select files from Infinite Scale, and share them without ever having to leave the chat tab.

The Embed Mode streamlines workflows and eliminates the need to switch between different applications to manage files.

[discrete]
=== Focused "New" Menu

The `New` menu items have been reorganized with the most frequently used items placed at the top. This rearrangement is based on user feedback, ensuring that the most important filetypes are readily accessible. In our commitment to Open Source and universal accessibility, we've revised the wording for Document labels to be more vendor-neutral. This change reflects our dedication to providing a user-friendly interface that caters to a universal user base.

[discrete]
=== Open the Sidebar From Everywhere
We have relocated the button to open the sidebar, positioning it now in the global top bar. This move allows users to access the right sidebar not just in the Files app, but also in a variety of other applications. This change provides a way for integrating features like file details and sharing options into other applications, beyond the Files app.

[discrete]
=== 400% Faster Upload Preparation Time

In the latest update, we've implemented significant improvements in the efficiency of folder tree creation during file uploads. By optimizing the process to run asynchronously and reducing the number of PROPFIND requests on nested folders, we've managed to substantially speed up this operation. In a test scenario with a folder containing 155 subfolders, the time to create these folders has been reduced from 20-30 seconds to just 5-7 seconds. While this duration may still be noticeable, it represents a considerable improvement, especially considering the limitations of client-side operations.

Additionally, we've massively enhanced the upload preparation time. Rather than setting file data individually for each file, we now collect all necessary data first and then apply it in a single batch using Uppy's setState method. This approach streamlines the upload process, making it much quicker and more efficient for users

[discrete]
=== Paste to Upload

With the "Paste to upload" feature, you can instantly upload a single file by simply pasting it from your clipboard via kbd:[CTRL+V] / kbd:[CMD+V] in the Web UI. This eliminates the need for traditional file selection and upload methods, providing you an intuitive and swift upload process. Note: For security reasons "Paste to upload" works only for a single file, not for multiple files or a folder. 
https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/9140[#9140]

[discrete]
=== Fulltext Search: Highlight Matches

Instead of just showing you the files that contain your search terms, it also highlights exactly where those terms are within each document. This will expedite your search for relevant content, saving you from the hassle of manually scanning through lengthy documents. Users can now activate the fulltext search by selecting the btn:[Search only in content] filter chip located on the search results page. This takes away the need for inputting search syntax. https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/9294[#9294]

[discrete]
=== Search: Location Filter

The location filter feature allows you to refine search by specifying the file location. Now, instead of searching throughout your entire storage system, you can specify to search only within your current folder. This allows for a faster, more accurate search result, saving you precious time and effort. https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/9304[#9304]

[discrete]
=== Search: Tag Filter

With the tag filter on the search results page, you can now refine your search results by specific tags. If you've assigned tags to your files and folders for better organization, you can utilize these tags as filters in your searches. This means you can narrow down your search results to only show items that carry a specific tag.

For example, if you're looking for a particular project file and you remember tagging it as "Project X", you can input "Project X" in the tag filter, and the search results will only display files and folders with that tag. This new feature is particularly useful when dealing with a large number of files, making your search more efficient and manageable. https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/9044[#9044], https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/9096[#9096]

[discrete]
=== Cloud Importer (experimental)

We are excited to announce our new extension: Cloud Importer, designed to import files from other services. With this functionality, you can now seamlessly import files and folders from other services like OneDrive, Google Drive, ownCloud 10 or Nextcloud directly into Infinite Scale.

Effortlessly transfer your work documents, shared files, or entire project folders from these popular cloud storage platforms to your account. Whether you're moving a single document or a large batch of files, the Cloud Importer ensures a smooth, fast, and reliable transfer. Note that the Cloud Importer only imports files, not shares or tags. Think of it as uploading a file, but from a cloud service instead of from your local drive.

The Cloud Importer is disabled by default. To enable this extension, please refer to the xref:{latest-ocis-version}@ocis:ROOT:deployment/container/orchestration/orchestration.adoc#docker-compose-examples[WOPI Docker Compose Deployment] Example. https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/6702[#6702]

This feature is experimental, i.e. its in a preview state, may break and individual production usage must be agreed with ownCloud Support.

[discrete]
=== Simplified Sharing Links

The simplified sharing links make sharing files with both internal and external parties easier than ever, while maintaining the highest levels of security and access control.

With simplified sharing links, you can generate a single, user-friendly link for any file or folder you want to share. This one link is all you need, whether you're sharing with team members within your organization or with external partners and clients.

The advanced design of simplified sharing links respects the permissions of all recipients, regardless of whether they're internal or external. This means that users will only gain the access levels (e.g. view, download, edit) that you authorize. It ensures secure, controlled sharing without compromising on ease of use.

An added benefit for internal users is the visibility of the file location. If permission is granted, internal users can see where the shared file is stored within the organization's file system. This enables them to navigate directly to the file location, eliminating the need to access the file via the shared link every time. This feature is particularly valuable for efficient collaboration and knowledge sharing within teams.

Simplified sharing links combines convenience, control, and clarity in one package. Experience a more streamlined and intuitive way to share files both within and outside your organization, while always maintaining control over your files' security and accessibility.

Note: If you create a sharing link that tries to grant more permissions than internal people have, the internal sharing permissions will take effect for internal people. In other words: The link acts as a "pointer" for internal people. https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/9299[#9299]

[discrete]
=== File Control Bar

The file control bar is a static, always accessible bar located within the user interface of the document viewer or editor. It is designed to provide a consistent location where users can find and use critical file-related functions such as btn:[close] or btn:[save]. https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/8442[#8442], https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/8447[#8447]

[discrete]
=== Links: Directly Open in Editor

When you share a document that has a standard associated application, the link will now open the document directly in its respective app, instead of showing the document as a single file listing as it did previously. This enables recipients to immediately begin viewing or editing the shared document, eliminating the extra step of navigating from the file listing to the actual document.

For instance, if you share a Word document, the recipient can click on the link and the document will open directly in its associated application, such as OnlyOffice or Microsoft Word, depending on the settings. https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/9046[#9046], https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/9307[#9307]

[discrete]
=== Drop Files to the Breadcrumb

You can now move files to a parent folder through a simple drag and drop action. Instead of navigating through multiple steps to move files, you can now simply grab the files you want to move and then drop them onto the breadcrumb trail representing the parent folders.

For example, if you're in a subfolder and want to move a file up one level, you can drag the file to the breadcrumb link representing the parent folder. The file will be moved instantly, eliminating the need for traditional cut-and-paste or move-to operations. https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/9052[#9052]

[discrete]
=== Context Menu on Whitespace

This feature allows you to right-click on any empty space (whitespace) within your file view to access the context menu. This action was previously limited to direct file or folder interaction, but we've expanded its functionality to utilize the whitespace as well, enhancing your control over the workspace. This new context menu provides quick access to commonly used operations. For instance, you can create a new folder directly from the menu, offering an expedited process for organizing your files. In addition, you can easily view details for the current folder, including its contents, shared status, and more, all from the same context menu. https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/8921[#8921]

[discrete]
=== View Spaces as List

Previously, viewing your spaces was limited to a tiles format. You can now switch to a list view that presents your projects in a clean, streamlined manner. This new view offers an overview of all your spaces, allowing for easy navigation and a concise visual of your work environment.

This list view provides additional information about the space:

* name of the manager
* number of members
* total quota
* used quota
* remaining quota
* status
* last modified date

in a more compact and organized manner. This is particularly useful for users who manage multiple spaces, as it allows for efficient scanning and selection. https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/9195[#9195]

[discrete]
=== Other Notable Changes

* Bugfix - Fixes for the Infinite Scale postprocessing restart command: Restarts the complete postprocessing pipeline if there is no active postprocessing: https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/6753[#6753]
* Enhancement - Add `ocis decomposedfs check-treesize` maintenance command: Verify the treesize metadata of a space in decomposedfs: https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/6556[#6556]
* Enhancement - Add server-sent events endpoint for notifications: https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/5998[#5998]
* Enhancement - Use reva client selectors to improve performance and scalability: https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/6452[#6452]
* Enhancement - Allow disabling WOPI chat to disable the inline chat in Only Office: https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/6544[#6544]
* Enhancement - Download a whole space as archive: https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/9056[#9056]
* Enhancement - We've implemented a new solution to deal with long breadcrumbs even with long folder names: https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/8984[#8984]
* Enhancement - Respect archiver limits. The archiver service announces a limit for the accumulated filesize of the currently selected resources. The web UI now respects those limits and shows a disabled download button once the limit has been reached. https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/9055[#9055]
* Enhancement - Privacy statement in account menu. We've added the option to add an imprint and privacy statement via the config:
 https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/9174[#9174]
* Enhancement - Allow local storage for auth token. We've introduced a new env var `WEB_OPTION_TOKEN_STORAGE_LOCAL`. When set to true (default), the auth token will be stored in the browser's local storage instead of the session storage. This will enable a persisted login state across multiple browser tabs. https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/9386[#9386]
* Enhancement - Add login button to top bar. We've added a login button to the top bar, this might be handy if a user receives a public link, and they want to login with their user account. https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/9178[#9178]
* Enhancement - Add pagination options to admin settings: https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/9199[#9199]
* Enhancement - Add batch actions to search result list: https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/9200[#9200]

=== Known Issues

* A critical issue has been discovered where users where able to search other users' spaces under certain circumstances.
* The environment variable `USERS_LDAP_USER_SCHEMA_ID` variable was accidently removed from the users service.

=== Migrations

* The space index of the decomposedFS will be migrated from symlinks to messagepack. This is an auto migration. See the xref:{latest-ocis-version}@ocis:ROOT:migration/upgrading-ocis.adoc[Upgrading Infinite Scale] documentation for more and important details.
* If you use a customized theme you need to add 3 new color tokens to the theme.json:
+
* `swatch-passive-hover-outline`
* `swatch-primary-muted-hover`
* `swatch-primary-gradient-hover`
+
{empty}
+
These colors ensure, that the primary and outlined buttons (e.g. "Upload" and "New") have a proper hover state.
* If you used `yes` or `no` in your YAML files, please change these values to `true` or `false`. Background: The YAML parser we use does not support `yes` or `no` any more.

=== Breaking Changes

* Client pool selectors have changed from IP addresses `127.0.0.1:9xxx` to service names `com.owncloud.api.*`.  https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/6452[#6452]
* All environment variables that were marked for deprecation in Infinite Scale release 4.0.0 have finally been removed. https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/7099[#7099]

See the xref:{latest-ocis-version}@ocis:ROOT:migration/upgrading-ocis.adoc[Upgrading Infinite Scale] documentation for important details.

== Infinite Scale 3.0.0

[discrete]
=== General

We are pleased to announce the availability of Infinite Scale 3.0.0 along with its clients for Web, Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS and Android.

Please find the full list of changes here:

* Infinite Scale: https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/releases/tag/v3.0.0[Changes in 3.0.0]
* Web: https://github.com/owncloud/web/releases/tag/v7.0.0[Changelog for ownCloud Web 7.0.0]

[discrete]
=== Antivirus (ICAP)

The Antivirus interface ensures secure file sharing by protecting against Trojans, viruses, and other malicious software. It scans files using an external antivirus scanning engine before storing them, preventing the spread of infected files. The integration of antivirus scanners through ICAP (Internet Content Adaptation Protocol) allows offloading of scanning to a dedicated service, improving performance and scalability. The interface works, for example, with ClamAV, a comprehensive virus scanner that detects various forms of malware in different file types. Read more: xref:{latest-ocis-version}@ocis:ROOT:deployment/services/s-list/antivirus.adoc[Antivirus Service]

Note: Because Infinite Scale is capable of asynchronous post-processing, the system can efficiently handle a large number of simultaneous file scans without causing delays or bottlenecks that keep end users waiting. Read more: xref:{latest-ocis-version}@ocis:ROOT:deployment/services/s-list/postprocessing.adoc#virus-scanning[Postprocessing Service].

[discrete]
=== File Firewall

The file firewall adds an additional layer of security to the file-level. With definable rules and criteria, the admin can restrict file uploads based, for example, on file extensions, mime types or even content. This granular control helps prevent unwanted or unauthorized uploads. 

Note: The file firewall utilizes Infinite Scale's policies service to check whether a requested operation is allowed or not. To do so, Open Policy Agent (OPA) is used to define the set of rules of what is permitted and what is not.
Policies are written in the Rego query language. Read more: xref:{latest-ocis-version}@ocis:ROOT:deployment/services/s-list/policies.adoc[Policies Service].

[discrete]
=== Tags

Tags provide a flexible and intuitive way to categorize files. By assigning relevant tags to files, users can easily locate specific documents through powerful search functions. This eliminates the need to remember precise file names or navigate through complex folder structures, saving valuable time and effort. Unlike traditional folder-based systems, tags offer a flexible way to organize files that transcends rigid hierarchies. Users can assign multiple tags to a single file, enabling them to classify and retrieve documents using different criteria simultaneously. This adaptability allows for personalized organization methods that align with individual preferences and working styles.

Tags are saved as metadata on the storage without the need for a dedicated database to assure resilience and scalability of the system.

[discrete]
=== Fulltext Search

Fulltext search revolutionizes the way you search and retrieve files, making it easier and more efficient to find the information you need. It enables you to search for files based on their content, not just their titles or metadata. This means you can enter keywords or phrases related to the actual text within documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and more. Say goodbye to manually scanning through countless files and folders — finding the right document is now just a search away.
Fulltext search utilizes Apache Tika for more advanced content extraction. Apache Tika ensures lightning-fast search results, delivering near-instantaneous responses to your queries. Whether you have a large document repository or a vast number of files, full text search will provide you with swift and accurate results, enabling you to access the information you need without delay.
With Apache Tika you can search the contents of files of the types: PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, ODF, HTML, XML, EPUB, RTF, Tar, RAR, AR, CPIO, Zip, 7Zip, Gzip, BZip2 and many more... Read more: xref:{latest-ocis-version}@ocis:ROOT:deployment/services/s-list/search.adoc#tika-extractor[Search Service].

[discrete]
=== Space Templates

Applying a template is a breeze. When creating a new project space, simply right-click on a folder of your choice, select "Create Space from selection" and the entire folder structure, complete with subfolders and files, will be instantly generated for a project space. Save time and ensure consistency by eliminating the need to manually create folders and subfolders every time you start a new project or onboard a new team. Space templates ensure a consistent folder structure across projects providing a standardized, efficient, and customizable approach to organizing your documents. Space Templates are only available to users with the permission to create spaces.

[discrete]
=== Custom User Roles

Infinite Scale ships with the default user roles admin, space admin, user and user light. Each role has different permissions. For example, only space admins can create spaces, but people with the role "User" cannot create a space. With custom roles, you can now configure roles that fit the needs of your organization. For example, if you need custom roles for your school, you can configure the roles "Teacher" and "Pupil" and not give pupils the permission to create public links. If you are interested in creating custom roles, reach out to us on https://talk.owncloud.com/channel/infinitescale[Talk].

[discrete]
=== File Versions: Design Overhaul

File versions received a design overhaul so that you can go back easily in the version history of a file. With the new design of the file versions feature, you now have even easier access to a comprehensive version history for each file. Every time a file is modified or updated, a new version is created and stored, preserving a complete timeline of changes. This allows you to track and revert to previous versions as needed, ensuring data integrity and eliminating the risk of accidental data loss.

[discrete]
=== Administration Settings

This update brings a range of functions to streamline user, group, and space administration, enhancing the overall management experience. Let's explore the exciting new capabilities:

[discrete]
==== Users Administration:

* Filter Chips for Groups and Role: +
https://m2.material.io/components/chips#filter-chips[Filter chips] use tags or descriptive words to filter content. With that, you can now conveniently filter users based on groups and roles, making it easier to locate and manage specific user segments efficiently.

* Batch Actions:
** Quota: +
Administrators can now modify the storage quota for multiple users at once, simplifying the management of storage allocations.
** Add to Group: +
Administrators can add multiple users to a group simultaneously, streamlining the process of assigning users to specific teams or projects.
** Remove from Group: +
Administrators can remove multiple users from a group in one go, ensuring efficient group membership management.
** Disable Login: +
Administrators can now disable login access for multiple users simultaneously, providing better control over user accounts.
** Edit Login (Dis/-allow): +
Administrators can enable or disable login access for multiple users, providing greater flexibility in managing user authentication.

* Edit Username: +
Administrators have the ability to edit the usernames, which is very important if users change their last name. Remember: In ownCloud Server, users where not allowed to marry and/or change names due to technical limitations. With Infinite Scale, marriage and name changes are now possible.

[discrete]
==== Groups Administration:

* Rename Group: +
Administrators can now rename groups, enabling them to update group names to better reflect their purpose or current project.
* Show Members of a Group: +
You can easily view a list of members belonging to a specific group, facilitating better oversight and management of group memberships.
* Filter Members of a Group: +
Administrators can filter group members, making it effortless to locate specific users within a group.

[discrete]
==== Spaces Administration:

List All Spaces: With appropriate permissions, administrators can now view a comprehensive list of all spaces within the organization. The following attributes are visible:

* Space Name
* Managers of the Space
* Amount of Members in the Space
* Remaining Quota
* Last Modified Date
* Status
// *Not visible:*
* View Contents of a Space: Please note that this update does not enable the viewing of contents within a space, including files, space images, or descriptions. This limitation ensures the security and privacy of space contents even from the eyes of an administrator.

[discrete]
=== GDPR Export

This update focuses on fulfilling the legal requirements of Article 20 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - the Right to Data Portability. This feature empowers users to exercise greater control over their personal data and ensures compliance with GDPR guidelines.

The GDPR Export feature enables users to easily export where and which personal data stored within Infinite Scale, in compliance with the Right to Data Portability outlined in Article 20 of the GDPR.
Users can now request and receive an export of their personal data in a JSON file, saved to the users' personal files.
The export can be requested at any time in self-service by the user.

[discrete]
=== Secret File Drop

The feature formerly known as "Uploader" has been renamed to "Secret File Drop", but the functionality stays the same: The Secret File Drop feature allows users to generate unique links that can be shared with external parties. Recipients can anonymously drop files through these links without the need for a registered account or visibility into other submissions. This ensures data privacy and eliminates the risk of unauthorized access.

Effortless File Collection: With Secret File Drop, collecting files becomes a seamless process. Simply create a file drop link, share it with recipients, and let them submit files directly without any additional steps or complications. This feature saves time and eliminates the need for manual file collection methods, such as email attachments or physical hand-ins.

[discrete]
=== 3 View Modes

Users can now choose three distinct view modes, enhancing file browsing and navigation options:

* *Compact List View* +
The Compact List View provides a condensed and space-efficient representation of your files and folders, designed for users who prefer a streamlined view.
* *Regular List View* +
The Regular List View offers a familiar and comprehensive approach to file organization.
* *Tiles View* +
The Tiles View introduces a visually appealing and intuitive way to browse your files and folders. In this mode, files and folders are displayed as colorful and resizable tiles, providing a visually engaging experience. Users can preview file contents and relevant details directly within the tiles, allowing for quick identification and navigation. This is particularly beneficial for users who prioritize visual recognition and prefer a visually rich interface.

[discrete]
=== Trash Bins for Spaces

The Separate Trash Bin for Spaces introduces individual trash bins for each space within your organization's file system. A space represents a dedicated area where teams collaborate on specific projects, departments, or initiatives. With this feature, accidental file deletions are a thing of the past, as files deleted within a space are now moved to a separate trash bin specific to that space.

[discrete]
=== Deny Access
The Deny Access feature, which is *experimental and not ready for production environments*, allows users to share folders with groups, but deny access to a single person in that group. Example: If you share the "Birthday Present" folder with all users in the organization, you want to exclude the one person whose birthday is coming up. This use case is now possible, but not yet production ready and disabled by default. To enable this feature, the xref:{latest-ocis-version}@ocis:ROOT:deployment/services/s-list/frontend.adoc#environment-variables[variable] `FRONTEND_OCS_ENABLE_DENIALS` needs to be set to to `true`. Please contact {oc-support-url}[ownCloud Support] or give us your feedback via {oc-central-url}[ownCloud Central] so that we can finalize this long-awaited feature with the help of your testing.

[discrete]
=== Other Notable Changes

- We added a config option for cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) which, for example, allows running the Web UI on another domain. https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/5987[#5987]

- We changed the default behavior of shares: Share receivers have no access to versions. People in spaces with the "Editor" or "Manager" role can still see versions and work with them. https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/5531[#5531]

- With ownCloud Web having transitioned to Vue 3 recently, we would have had to port the settings ui as well. The decision was made to discontinue the settings ui instead. As a result all traces of the settings ui have been removed. The only user facing setting that ever existed in the settings service is now integrated into the `account` page of ownCloud Web (click on top right user menu, then on your username to reach the account page). https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/5463[#5463]

- We changed the default behavior of shares: Share receivers have no access to versions. People in spaces with the "Can edit" or "Can manage" role can still see versions and work with them. https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/5531[#5531]

- To provide more monitoring metrics, we added a debug server to the services "audit", "idm", "userlog", "eventhistory" and "postprocessing". https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/6178[#6178], https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/6153[#6153], https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/6203[#6203], https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/6202[#6202], https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/6204[#6204]

- You can now send prettier notification emails with HTML templates https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/6147[#6147]

- Webfinger: If your deployment consists of multiple instances, the webfinger service offers the right instances for the right users so that they can login without having to rember instance specific urls. https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/5373[#5373], https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/6110[#6110]

- Async postprocessing allows the system to do postprocessing tasks like virusscan, copying of bytes to their final destination, etc. asynchronous to the users request. This is a huge enhancement only available with Infinite Scale!  https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/5207[#5207]

- We introduced a new setting to disable email notifications https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/6137[#6137]

- The LDAP base DN for new groups is now configurable: The LDAP backend for the Graph service introduced a new config option for setting the Parent DN for new groups created via the `/groups/` endpoint. (`GRAPH_LDAP_GROUP_CREATE_BASE_DN`). It defaults to the value of `GRAPH_LDAP_GROUP_BASE_DN`. If set to a different value the `GRAPH_LDAP_GROUP_CREATE_BASE_DN` needs to be a subordinate DN of `GRAPH_LDAP_GROUP_BASE_DN`. All existing groups with a DN outside the `GRAPH_LDAP_GROUP_CREATE_BASE_DN` tree will be treated as read-only groups. So it is not possible to edit these groups. In the UI this is indicated via a lock-icon in the administration settings. https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/5974[#5974]

- Disable login for specific users: This new option in the administration settings allows login to be disabled / enabled for specific users. By setting the `accountEnabled` property to `false` for a user via the graph API, users can be disabled (i.e. they can no longer login). https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/5588[#5588]

- New service `eventhistory`: It is a service that stores events and provides a grpc API to retrieve them. Users will notice this enhancement by the bell on the top right in the Web UI and the corresponding notifications (ex: if a user receives a share or becomes a member of a space). 

- New service `policies`: The policies-service provides a new grpc api which can be used to return whether a requested operation is allowed or not. Open Policy Agent is used to determine the set of rules of what is permitted and what is not.
+
--
2 further levels of authorization build on this:

* *Proxy Authorization* +
The simplest authorization layer is in the proxy, since every request is processed here, only simple decisions that can be processed quickly are made here, more complex queries such as file evaluation are explicitly excluded in this layer.

* *Event Authorization* (needs async post-processing enabled) +
The next layer is event-based as a pipeline step in asynchronous post-processing, since processing at this point is asynchronous, the operations there can also take longer and be more expensive, the bytes of a file can be examined here as an example.

Since the base block is a GRPC API, it is also possible to use it directly. Policies are written in the https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/[rego query language]. https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/5714[#5714]
--

- Enforce passwords on public links: Added a new config option to enforce passwords on public links with "Uploader,Editor,Contributor" roles. The new options are: `OCIS_SHARING_PUBLIC_WRITEABLE_SHARE_MUST_HAVE_PASSWORD`,`SHARING_PUBLIC_WRITEABLE_SHARE_MUST_HAVE_PASSWORD` and `FRONTEND_OCS_PUBLIC_WRITEABLE_SHARE_MUST_HAVE_PASSWORD`. Check the docs on how to properly set them. https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/5848[#5848]

- We added the possibility to restrict the creation of public links based on user roles (permission). https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/5690[#5690]

- Added possibility to assign roles based on OIDC claims: https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/6048[#6048]

- Default quota based on user role: With this enhancement roles can now be configured with a default quota (eg. Admins should have a default quota of 100GB, Users should have a default quota of 50GB). https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/5616[#5616]

- Set default quota for project spaces: Additionally to `set-space-quota` for setting quota on personal spaces we now have `Drive.ReadWriteQuota.Project` for setting project spaces quota. https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/5660[#5660]

- Automatically emtpy the trashbin (off per default): Introduction of a new cli command to purge old trash-bin items. https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/5500[#5500]

=== Known Issues

- The environment variable xref:{latest-ocis-version}@ocis:ROOT:deployment/services/env-vars-special-scope.adoc[OCIS_LDAP_DISABLE_USER_MECHANISM] is an option to control the behavior for disabling users. The default value is `attribute` and requires configuration on the LDAP server. Enabling and disabling users is LDAP implementation specific.
+
--
- If you are using an external LDAP server you can either set `OCIS_LDAP_DISABLE_USER_MECHANISM` to `none` to disable it completely or to `attribute` in which case you need to set `OCIS_LDAP_USER_ENABLED_ATTRIBUTE` according to your external LDAP server's requirements.
- Additionally and due to a bug recently discovered in the xref:{latest-ocis-version}@ocis:ROOT:deployment/services/s-list/idp.adoc[IDP] service, you must set `OCIS_LDAP_USER_ENABLED_ATTRIBUTE=""` to overwrite the default setting when `OCIS_LDAP_DISABLE_USER_MECHANISM` is set to `none`. This bug will be fixed in a subsequent release.
--

=== Migrations

- Please note the xref:{latest-ocis-version}@ocis:ROOT:migration/upgrading-ocis.adoc#version-2-0-0-to-3-0-0[Upgrading Infinite Scale] documentation.

=== Breaking Changes

- Metadata in MessagePack: Metadata are no longer stored in the xattr of a file, but in a dedicated, more scalable and robust file in the binary `MessagePack` format. https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/3728[cs3org/reva#3728]
- The Web UI was updated from Vue.js 2 to Vue.js 3. https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/7948[#7948]

[WARNING]
====
In order to make every ocis storage provider ID unique by default, the use use of a random uuidv4 during ocis init was needed. Existing installations need to set this value explicitly or ocis will terminate after the upgrade.

See the https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/releases/tag/v2.0.0[BREAKING CHANGE in ocis deployments] description for details.
====

== Beta Releases

=== Beta 8

Infinite Scale 2.0.0 Beta 8 includes a huge number of smaller bug fixes and polishing all around. It introduces a more efficient and scalable way to store share information and improves the performance of ownCloud Web in many areas very noticeably. Furthermore it is now possible to set user quotas in the UI and administrators can now delete orphaned spaces.

IMPORTANT: When updating from Infinite Scale Beta 7 or lower to Beta 8 it is necessary to run two migration steps from the previous to the new share manager **before** starting the system again.

**Migration for User/Group Shares**

`OCIS_LOG_LEVEL="debug" OCIS_LOG_PRETTY="true" OCIS_LOG_COLOR="true" ocis migrate shares --from cs3 --to jsoncs3`

If you have set up your system with Docker, you can just use the same syntax as with https://doc.owncloud.com/ocis/next/deployment/container/container-setup.html#first-time-start[ocis init]:

```
docker run --rm -it \
    --mount type=bind,source=$PWD/ocis/ocis-config,target=/etc/ocis \
    owncloud/ocis migrate shares
```

**Migration for Public Links**

`OCIS_LOG_LEVEL="debug" OCIS_LOG_PRETTY="true" OCIS_LOG_COLOR="true" ocis migrate publicshares --from cs3 --to jsoncs3`

If you have set up your system with Docker, you can just use the same syntax as with https://doc.owncloud.com/ocis/next/deployment/container/container-setup.html#first-time-start[ocis init]:

```
docker run --rm -it \
    --mount type=bind,source=$PWD/ocis/ocis-config,target=/etc/ocis \
    owncloud/ocis migrate publicshares
```

The most prominent changes in **Infinite Scale 2.0.0 beta8** and ownCloud Web 5.7.0 comprise:

===== Changed oCIS JSON share driver storage format

Related: https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1655[reva#1655]

The storage format of the oCIS JSON share driver has changed. You will be affected if you plan to update from a previous version of oCIS to oCIS 1.6.0, you have shared files or folders with users or groups and you are using the oCIS JSON share driver, which is currently the default share driver.

.Implications:
* manual action required

.Our recommended update strategy to oCIS 1.6.0 is:
. let users note all their shares with users and groups they set up in oCIS
. stop oCIS
. move / delete the JSON share driver storage file `/var/tmp/ocis/storage/shares.json`
. update to oCIS 1.6.0
. let users recreate their shares

===== Fixed / changed oCIS metadata storage driver filesystem path

Related: https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1956[ocis#1956]

The filesystem path of the oCIS metadata storage driver has changed (been fixed). You will be affected if you plan to update from a previous version of oCIS to oCIS 1.6.0 and are using the oCIS storage driver for metadata storage.

.Implications:
* manual action required

.Our recommended update strategy to oCIS 1.6.0 is:
. let users backup all their data stored in oCIS
. stop oCIS
. prune all oCIS data in `/var/tmp/ocis`
. update to oCIS 1.6.0
. recreate user accounts (can be skipped if an external IDP is used)
. let users upload all their data again
. let users recreate their shares

If you want to use oCIS 1.6.0 without following our recommended update strategy, you can also keep the pre 1.6.0 behaviour by setting this environment variable:

[source,bash]
----
export STORAGE_SYSTEM_ROOT=/var/tmp/ocis/storage/users
----

This may lead to faulty behaviour since both the metadata and user storage driver will be storing their data in the same filesystem path.

=== Infinite Scale 1.5.0 Technology Preview

Version 1.5.0 is a maintenance release for the Infinite Scale backend with a number of bug fixes and smaller improvements. For ownCloud Web it brings further accessibility improvements and a whole bunch of new features.

===== Changed oCIS storage driver file layout

Related: https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1452[reva#1452]

Despite a breaking change in the oCIS storage driver file layout, data is not automatically migrated. You will be affected if you plan to update from a previous version of oCIS to oCIS 1.4.0 and are using the oCIS storage driver, which is currently the default storage driver.

.Implications:
* manual action required

.Our recommended update strategy to oCIS 1.4.0 is:
. let users backup all their data stored in oCIS
. stop oCIS
. prune all oCIS data in `/var/tmp/ocis`
. update to oCIS 1.4.0
. recreate user accounts (can be skipped if an external IDP is used)
. let users upload all their data again
. let users recreate their shares

If you already updated to oCIS 1.4.0 without our recommended update strategy you will see no data in oCIS anymore, even after a downgrade to your previous version of oCIS. But be assured that your data is still there.

.You have to follow these steps to be able to access your data again in oCIS:
. stop oCIS
. navigate to `/var/tmp/ocis/storage/users/nodes/root/`
. in this directory you will find directories with UUID as names. These are the home folders of the oCIS users. In the ones with content your oCIS users uploaded to oCIS.
. create an temporary directory e.g. `/tmp/dereferenced-ocis-storage`
. copy the data from oCIS to the temporary directory while dereferencing symlinks. On Linux you can do this by running `cp --recursive --dereference /var/tmp/ocis/storage/users/nodes/root/ /tmp/dereferenced-ocis-storage`
. you now have a backup of all users data in `/tmp/dereferenced-ocis-storage` and can follow our recommended update strategy above

You can also read the full https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/releases/tag/v1.1.0[Infinite Scale changelog] for further details on what has changed.

=== Infinite Scale 1.0.0 Technology Preview

We are pleased to announce the availability of Infinite Scale 1.0.0 Technology Preview which is released as the first public version of the new Infinite Scale platform.

==== Microservice architecture

Infinite Scale is following the microservices architectural pattern. It is implemented as a set of microservices which are independent of each other. They are coupled with well-defined APIs. This architecture fosters a lot of benefits that we were aiming for with the new design for oCIS:

* Every service is independent, comparably small and brings it's own webserver, backend/APIs and frontend components

* Each service runs as a separate service on the system, increasing security and stability

* Scalability:  High performance demands can be fulfilled by scaling and distributing of services

* Testability: Each service can be tested on its own due to well-defined APIs and functionality

* Protocol-driven development using protobuf

* High-performance communication between services through gRPC

* Multi-platform support powered by Golang - only minimal dependency on platform packages

* Cloud-native deployment, update, monitoring, logging, tracing and orchestration strategies

==== Key figures

* The all-new ownCloud Web frontend is shipped as part of the platform

* OpenID Connect is the future-proof technology choice for authentication

* An Identity Provider is bundled to ease deployment and operations. It can be replaced with an external OpenID IdP, if desired

* Automatically built and fully maintained Docker containers are available

* Flexible configuration through environment variables, config files or command-line flags

* Database-less architecture - metadata and data are kept together in the storage as a single source of truth

* Native storage capabilities are used where like native versioning and trashbin

* Public APIs like WebDAV and OCS have been kept compatible with ownCloud 10

* A secure and flexible framework to create extensions

===== Supported platforms

* Linux-amd64
* Darwin-amd64
* Experimental: Windows, ARM (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Termux on Android)

===== Client support

All official ownCloud Clients support the Infinite Scale server with the following versions:

* Desktop >= 2.7
* Android >= 2.15
* iOS >= 1.2

==== Architecture components

Infinite Scale is built as a modular framework in which components can be scaled individually. It consists of

* a user management service
* a settings service
* a frontend service
* a storage backend service
* a built-in IdP
* an application gateway/proxy

These components can be deployed in a multi-tier deployment architecture. See the https://owncloud.dev[developer documentation] for an overview of the services.

==== Operation modes

===== Standalone mode (with oCIS storage driver)

In standalone mode oCIS uses its built-in orchestrator to start all necessary services. This allows you to run oCIS on a single node without any outside dependencies like docker-compose, kubernetes or even a webserver. It will start an OpenID IdP and create a self-signed certificate. You can start right away by navigating to `\https://localhost:9200`

===== Single services scaleout

oCIS allows you to scale individual services using well-known orchestration frameworks like docker-compose, dockerSwarm and kubernetes.

===== Bridge mode with ownCloud 10 backend

For the product transition phase, Infinite Scale comes with an operation mode ("bridge mode") that allows a hybrid deployment, between both server generations to operate the new web frontend with ownCloud 10 and Infinite Scale in parallel. This setup allows the ownCloud Web frontend to operate with both server generations and provides the foundation to migrate users gradually to the new backend.

**Requirements for the bridge mode**

* ownCloud Server >= 10.6
* https://marketplace.owncloud.com/apps/openidconnect[Open ID Connect] is used for user authentication
* The https://marketplace.owncloud.com/apps/graphapi[Graph API] app is installed on ownCloud Server
* The latest client versions are rolled-out to users (required for OpenID Connect support). See the https://doc.owncloud.com/server/admin_manual/configuration/user/oidc/#owncloud-desktop-and-mobile-clients[documentation] for more information.

See the https://owncloud.dev/ocis/deployment/bridge/[documentation] on how to deploy Infinite Scale in bridge mode.

[IMPORTANT]
====
**Technology Preview**

Infinite Scale is currently in Technology Preview. The bridge mode should only be used in non-production environments.
====

==== What to expect?

This is the first promoted public release of Infinite Scale, released as "Technical Preview". Infinite Scale is not yet ready for production installations. Technical audiences will be able to get a good understanding of the potential of ownCloud's new platform.

Version 1.0.0 comes with the base functionality for sync and share with a much higher performance-, stability- and security-level compared to all available platforms. Based on ten years of experience in enterprise sync and share and a long standing collaboration with the biggest global science organizations this new platform will exceed what content collaboration is today.

==== How to get started?

One of the most important objectives for oCIS was to ease the setup of a working instance dramatically. Since oCIS is built with Google's powerful Go language it supports the single-file-deployment: Installing oCIS 1.0.0 is as easy as downloading a single file, applying execution permission to it and get started. No more fiddling around with complicated LAMP stacks.

===== Deployment Options

Given the architecture of Infinite Scale, there are various deployment options based on the users requirements. In our experience setting up the LAMP stack for ownCloud 10 was difficult for many users. Therefore a big emphasis was put on easy yet functional https://owncloud.dev/ocis/deployment/[deployment] strategies.

===== Delivery as single binary

The single binary is the best option to test the new Infinite Scale 1.0.0 Technical Preview release on a local machine. Follow these instructions to get the platform running in the most simple way:

1. Download the binary +
    **Linux** +
    `curl https://download.owncloud.com/ocis/ocis/1.0.0/ocis-1.0.0-linux-amd64 -o ocis` +
    **MacOS** +
    `curl https://download.owncloud.com/ocis/ocis/1.0.0/ocis-1.0.0-darwin-amd64 -o ocis`

2. Make it executable +
    `chmod +x ocis`

3. Run it +
    `./ocis server`

4. Navigate to `\https://localhost:9200` and log in to ownCloud Web (admin:admin)

Production environments will need a more sophisticated setup, see https://owncloud.dev/ocis/deployment/[deployment] for more information.

===== Containerized Setup

For more sophisticated setups we recommend using one of our docker setup examples. See the https://owncloud.dev/ocis/deployment/ocis_traefik/[documentation] for a setup with https://traefik.io/traefik/[Traefik] as a reverse proxy which also includes automated SSL certificate provisioning using Letsencrypt tools.

===== Storage

The default oCIS storage driver deconstructs a filesystem to be able to efficiently look up files by fileid as well as path. It stores all folders and files by a uuid and persists share and other metadata using extended attributes. This allows using the linux VFS cache using stat syscalls instead of a database or key/value store. The driver implements trash, versions and sharing. It not only serves as the current default storage driver, but also as a blueprint for future storage driver implementations.

===== User and group management

- Functionality available via API and frontend ("Accounts" extension)
- User listing (API/FE)
- User creation (API/FE)
- User deletion (API/FE)
- User activation/blocking (API/FE)
- Role assignment for users (API/FE)
- User editing (API)
- Multi-select in the frontend (delete & block/activate)
- Group creation (API)
- Add/remove users to/from groups (API)
- Group deletion (API)
- Create/read/update/delete users and groups (CLI)

====== Settings

The settings service provides APIs for other services for registering a set of settings as `Bundle`. It also provides a pluggable extension for ownCloud Web which provides dynamically built web forms, so that users can customize their own settings. Some well known settings are directly used by ownCloud Web for adapted user experience, e.g. the UI language. Services can query the users' chosen settings for customized backend and frontend operations as needed.

====== Roles & Permissions System

Infinite Scale follows a role-based access control model. Based on permissions for actions which are provided by the system and by extensions, roles can be composed. Ultimately, these roles can be assigned to users to define what users are permitted to do. This model allows a segregation of duties for administration and allows granular control of how different types of users (e.g., Guests) can use the platform.

* Currently available permissions: Manage accounts (gives access to the internal user management), manage roles (allows assigning roles to users)

* The current roles are exemplary default roles which are used for demonstration purposes
** "Admin": Has the permissions to "manage accounts" and to "manage roles"
** "User": Does not have any dedicated permission
** "Guest": Does not have any dedicated permission

* Currently a user can only have one role

* Users with the role "Admin" can assign/unassign roles to/from other users (as part of the permission to "manage roles")

===== APIs

* WebDAV
* OCS

==== Known issues

* There are feature differences depending on the operation mode, e.g., no user management with ownCloud Web and oC 10 backend

* Public links do not yet respect the given role (a recipient has full permissions no matter which role has been set)

* Resharing does not yet work as expected
** Share recipients can create public links with higher permissions than they originally had
** Share recipients can add other people but they will not be able to access the data

* Sharing indicators in the file list will only be shown after opening the right sidebar for a resource

* Users can't change their password yet

* Folder sizes will not be calculated

* Cleanups are not yet available (e.g., shares of a deleted user will not be removed)

* Sharing from the desktop client does not work yet

* There are no notifications yet

* There can be issues with access tokens not being refreshed correctly, leading to interruptions, e.g., during uploads

* Deleting non-empty folders from the trash bin does not work

* Emptying the whole trash bin does not work
