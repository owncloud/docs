= File Lifecycle Management
:toc: right

== Introduction

The File Lifecycle Management extension allows service providers to manage the lifecycle of files within ownCloud to

- keep storage usage under control by limiting the time users can work with files before they are cleaned up automatically
- comply with regulations (like GDPR or company policies) by imposing automated retention and deletion policies for files that contain e.g., personal data and may only be stored in the company for a certain period of time.

To impose a workflow of Use => Archive => Delete, the extension equips ownCloud with a dedicated archive and allows administrators to define rules for automated archiving (days passed since upload) and subsequent deletion of files (days passed since archiving). Only files are archived as folders do not consume storage space and existing folder structures should be kept available. The archiving and deletion processes are controlled by background jobs.

Depending on the desired level of enforcement, the extension provides two policies to control the restoration of files from the archive if they are still needed:

- xref:soft-policy[Soft policy]: Users can restore files in self-service
- xref:hard-policy[Hard policy]: Only administrators or group administrators can restore files on request

Users can view the lifecycle status for a file and see when the file is scheduled for archiving or deletion. All lifecycle events of a file are displayed transparently. They can be tracked for individual files as well as for a whole user account using the {oc-marketplace-url}/apps/activity[Activity] stream.

To stay informed, users can also receive regular Activity summaries by email. For auditing purposes, the extension integrates with the {oc-marketplace-url}/apps/admin_audit[Auditing] app to provide all events of interest in the logs.

== Setup & Configuration

See the xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#file-lifecycle-management[lifecycle occ command set] for details when using the command line.

=== Archive Location

By default, archived files are stored within the ownCloud data directory but outside the users' files directories so that they are not accessible using the Web UI and other clients.

=== Setting Upload Times for Existing Files

File Lifecycle Management uses the _upload time_ of files (server time at which they first appeared on the ownCloud server) to determine when to archive them. As ownCloud Server generally does not store this metadata, the File Lifecycle Management extension takes care of this when it is enabled.

When File Lifecycle Management is set up on an existing ownCloud installation, you therefore have to set an _upload time_ for all files that existed before the extension has been enabled. The same applies if it was temporarily disabled. Only then can the archiving policies work. To set an upload time for all files that do not yet have one, you can use the _occ_ command `lifecycle:set-upload-time`. 

TIP: Files without an _upload time_ will not be considered for archiving.

TIP: You only have to conduct this process once when setting up File Lifecycle Management on an installation with existing files or if it was temporarily disabled . Files added after enabling File Lifecycle Management will be tracked automatically.

Example to set missing upload time values to November, 1st 2019: 

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} lifecycle:set-upload-time 2019-11-01
----

TIP: The extension only considers files. Folder structures are kept available.

=== Policy Configuration

==== Overview

File Lifecycle Management uses policies to determine which files to archive and when, as well as when to expire the files from archive. In addition, a soft and a hard policy are available to control whether users can restore archived files in self-service or not.

Three options are available for controlling the archiving and expiration policies, all set via the `config:app:set` _occ_ command under the `files_lifecycle` app:

- `archive_period` - The number of days passed after upload (or restore) that files will be archived
- `expire_period` - The number of days passed after archiving that files will be permanently deleted
- `excluded_groups` - Allows defining groups of users that are exempt from the Lifecycle policies (comma-separated group ids)

Example to set the time passed since upload (or restore) for archiving files to 90 days:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:app:set files_lifecycle archive_period --value='90'
----

To query existing values, use this example command:
[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:app:get files_lifecycle archive_period
----

==== Restoration Policies for Users

===== Soft Policy
  
The _soft policy_ aims at use cases where users should be allowed to restore files from the archive in self-service if they are still needed. It imposes a soft archiving enforcement but on the other hand relieves IT departments when archived files need to be restored.
The _soft policy_ is used by default. To switch from the hard policy to the soft policy, use this _occ_ command:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:app:set files_lifecycle policy --value='soft'
----

===== Hard Policy

The _hard policy_ is designed to enforce strict controls on user data, forcing archiving after the defined time and requiring escalated permissions in order to restore. If the archived data is still needed, users need to get in contact with a privileged manager and request the restoration.

TIP: When the _hard policy_ is in place only administrators (or also group administrators, depending on the configuration) are able to restore files from the archive by impersonating the respective users. The {oc-marketplace-url}/apps/impersonate[Impersonate app] has to be installed and enabled as a prerequisite. Apart from that, system administrators can also use _occ_ commands to restore data from the archive (see section xref:restoring-files[Restoring Files]).

To put the _hard policy_ in place, use this _occ_ command:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:app:set files_lifecycle policy --value='hard'
----

=== Archive and Expiration Background Jobs

To put File Lifecycle Management into actual operation, there are two _occ_ commands for archiving files and for permanently deleting them from the archive. Scanning the database for files that are due for archiving or expiration, given the chosen policies, can take some time. For this reason, these jobs are delegated to specific _occ_ commands which should be executed using CRON on a daily schedule.

==== Archiving Background Job
To move files scheduled for archiving (days since upload/restore > `archive_time`) into the archive, execute the following _occ_ command:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} lifecycle:archive
----

TIP: There is a dry-run mode (append `-d`) that simulates the execution of this command to allow checking the configuration before putting the actual process in place.

==== Archive Expiration Background Job
To permanently delete files from the archive that have met the policy rules (days since archiving > `expire_period`), execute the following _occ_ command:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} lifecycle:expire
----

TIP: There is a dry-run mode (append `-d`) that simulates the execution of this command to allow checking the configuration before putting the actual process in place.

=== Restoring Files

If archived files are still needed, users can restore them in self-service (_soft policy_) or have to request the restoration via privileged managers (_hard policy_).

TIP: When files have been restored, they can again be used for the same amount of time as they were initially available.

Apart from that, system administrators can restore files from the archive using the _occ_ command `lifecycle:restore`:

==== Restoration by Path
When a user `alice` requests to restore all files, e.g., in the folder `/work/projects/project1`, a system administrator can execute the following command:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} lifecycle:restore /alice/archive/files/work/projects/project1
----

==== Restoring All Files from All Archives
File Lifecycle Management provides a way to restore all files from all archives back to their owners' file directories. To do this, system administrators can use the `restore-all` _occ_ command:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} lifecycle:restore-all
----

The command will restore all files from all users and report on the progress.

TIP: There is a dry-run mode (append `-d`) that simulates the execution of this command to allow checking the configuration before putting the actual process in place.

=== Enabling/Disabling the User Interface Components

In some scenarios it can be desired to disable the whole user interface for this app. This can be done by setting the following configuration value:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:app:set files_lifecycle disable_ui --value='yes'
----

To enable the user interface components again, this config value needs to be removed:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:app:delete files_lifecycle disable_ui
----

== Audit Events

During archiving, restoring and expiration, Audit events are emitted. Logging those to the `audit.log` requires the minimum version 2.0.0 of the {oc-marketplace-url}/apps/admin_audit[Auditing] app.

== Further Notes about Archived Files

- File shares will disappear after archiving. When restoring archived files, shares will also be restored.
- Users' archives currently can't be transferred with the occ command `transfer-ownership`
- Files within a user's trash bin are not archived. The regular trash bin deletion policies have to be used to take care of those.
- Archived files count towards the user's quota
