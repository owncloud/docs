= Enterprise Logging Apps

The *Log user and file sharing actions* app (`apps/admin_audit`) records
the file sharing activity of your users, file tagging, and user logins
and logouts.

Your logging level must be set to at least *Info, warnings, errors, and
fatal issues* on your ownCloud admin page, or `'loglevel' => 1` in
`config.php`.

View your logfiles on your admin page. Click the *Download logfile*
button to dump the plain text log, or open the logfile directly in a
text editor. The default location is `owncloud/data/owncloud.log`.

TIP: See xref:configuration/server/logging/logging_configuration.adoc[Logging Configuration] and xref:enterprise/file_management/files_tagging.adoc[File Tagging] for more information on logging and tagging.
