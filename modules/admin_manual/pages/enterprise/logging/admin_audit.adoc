== Introduction

The {oc-marketplace-url}/apps/admin_audit[Auditing] app is an Enterprise only app and available on the marketplace. It traces user and admin actions. In particular the events:

* Login and logout events of users
* File system operations (create / delete / move; including actions on the trash bin and versioning)
* Sharing operations (user / group sharing, sharing via link, changing permissions, calls to sharing API from clients)
* Custom Groups events
* File tagging operations (add / remove tags)
* File commenting operations (create / update / delete)
* User management operations (creation / deletion / activation / deactivation of users, group management)
* User settings changes
* Impersonation events
* Enabling / disabling of ownCloud Apps
* Executions of OCC commands (CLI)

TIP: You may also want to check out the {splunk-url}[_ownCloud App for Splunk_]. For more information, read this xref:configuration/integration/splunk.adoc[section].

== Installation and Enabling

Download the {oc-marketplace-url}/apps/admin_audit[Auditing] app from the marketplace and enable it in the ownCloud app settings.

== Configuration

It is advised to redirect messages into a separate file. To do so, add these lines to `config.php` and adjust the target path accordingly. Note that the target path must be writeable for the web server user:

[source,console]
----
'log.conditions' => [
	[
		'apps' => ['admin_audit'],
		'logfile' => '/var/www/owncloud/data/admin_audit.log'
	]
]
----

NOTE: All messages regardless of log level will be logged there.

To ignore all CLI triggered events (default is to include them), set the following option:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:app:set admin_audit ignore_cli_events --value='yes'
----

== Grouped Logging

With each log message, a number of users are calculated to be the 'audit context'. This is the list of users which are related to the log message. Additionally, each log message includes a list of groups that the users are a member of, to enable filtering / splitting of the log messages at a later date. In cases when users are members of many groups, to reduce the data output, the group list can be filtered by adding the following to your `config.php`. Change the groups needed accordingly:

[source,console]
----
'admin_audit.groups' => [
    'group1',
    'group2'
]
----

When the filter is configured, only the filtered list of groups will be output in _auditGroups_, else, all groups that the _auditUsers_ are a member of are output.

== View and Download Logs

NOTE: If you have configured a different logfile than the default, you must download it manually.

To download your logfile on your admin page. Click menu:Settings[Admin > Download logfile]. The default location for manually downloading the standard ownCloud log is `data/owncloud.log`.

TIP: See xref:configuration/server/logging/logging_configuration.adoc[Logging Configuration] and xref:enterprise/file_management/files_tagging.adoc[File Tagging] for more information on logging and tagging.

== Connect with Splunk Cloud

=== Install the Universal Forwarder

Connect to the deployment server, change `input-prd-your-server-here` according your setup:

`splunk set deploy-poll input-prd-your-server-here.cloud.splunk.com:8089`

=== Install the Splunk Cloud credentials

`splunk install app path/to/splunkclouduf.spl -auth admin:changeme`

=== Monitor the `admin_audit.log` 

To Monitor the ownCloud Splunk audit log, add this to `inputs.conf`, assuming you use the custom logging path/file from above:

[source,console]
----
[monitor://var/www/owncloud/data/admin_audit.log]
 disabled = false
 sourcetype = _json
 index = main
----

Finally, configure the following `props.conf` to ensure the time field is correctly used and the fields are extracted.

[source,console]
----
[_json]
 INDEXED_EXTRACTIONS = json
 KV_MODE = json
 TIMESTAMP_FIELDS = [Time]
 category = Structured
----

=== Extra Fields

The audit app listens for internal ownCloud events and hooks and produces a rich set of audit entries useful for reporting on usage of your ownCloud server.

Log entries are based upon the internal ownCloud logging system, but utilise extra fields to hold relevant data fields related to the specific event. Each event will contain the following data at a minimum:

[width="100%",cols="25%,20%,100%",options="header"]
