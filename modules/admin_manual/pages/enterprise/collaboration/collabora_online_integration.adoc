= Secure View
:secure-view-label: Secure View (with watermarks)

When Collabora Online is properly setup and integrated into ownCloud Server (10.2 or above) Secure View functionality is available.
Secure View is a mode where users can place limitations on files and folders that are shared. 
These limitations include:
* No copying
* No downloading
* No editing
* Watermarking
+
NOTE: Administrators can configure the watermark text.
* Optional printing and exporting to PDF with watermarks included

IMPORTANT: Documents never leave the server when shared with Secure View.
Collabora Online Server opens them and streams the files to the user's browser (much like a video stream).
Consequently, there's no way to extract the original document from the browser.

== Supported File Formats

Secure View only supports a limited number of file formats; these are:

* Microsoft Word (.docx)
* Microsoft Excel (.xlsx)
* Microsoft PowerPoint (.pptx)
* OpenDocument Text Document (.odt)
* OpenDocument Presentation Document (.odp)
* OpenDocument Spreadsheet Document (.ods)
* PDF

If a folder shared with Secure View contains unsupported file types (e.g., JPG), they will not be accessible in any way.

== Prerequisites

* ownCloud 10.3 or higher _Enterprise Edition_
* Collabora Online set up and integrated

NOTE: This functionality is *not* available in the community edition and does not work with Public Links.

== How to Enable Secure View

To enable _Secure View_, navigate to menu:Settings[Admin > Additional (Admin) > Collabora Online].
At the bottom of the Collabora Online section, enable btn:[Enable Secure View].

Once enabled, default share permissions for all users can, optionally, be enabled. 
Currently, these default share permissions are:

* *{secure-view-label}*. 
   When enabled, files are shared in Secure View mode. In this mode , all xref:secure-view-mode-limitations[the Secure View limitations] are in-effect. 
   When this mode and "_can edit_" are disabled, the share is a regular, "read-only", share.
* *can print / export PDF*.

--
NOTE: This option is only visible if btn:[{secure-view-label}] is enabled.

When enabled, this mode allows documents to be can be printed or exported to PDF format — with a watermark — through Collabora Online.
--

NOTE: Admins can specify that all shares are "_Secure View_" by default and that the user has to intentionally change this setting, and vice versa.

When "_{secure-view-label}_" is enabled, any attempts to download the file will be blocked, as exemplified in the screenshot below.
Additionally, select, copy, and paste are disabled.
