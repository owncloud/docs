Secure View is a mode where users can only read, and optionally comment on, files.

NOTE: This is not available in the community edition, nor for Public Links.

To enable _Secure View_, navigate to menu:Settings[Admin > Additional (Admin) > Collabora Online].
At the bottom of the Collabora Online section, enable btn:[Enable Secure View].

Once enabled, default share permissions for all users can, optionally, be enabled. 
Currently, these default share permissions are:

* *can view with watermark*. 
   Documents can be printed or exported through Collabora Online. If this option is disabled, documents can only be viewed with a watermark.
* *can print/export*. 
   Documents can be viewed through Collabora Online, but will be watermarked.

When "_can view with watermark_" is enabled, any attempts to download the file will be blocked, as exemplified in the screenshot below.
Additionally, select, copy, and paste are disabled.
