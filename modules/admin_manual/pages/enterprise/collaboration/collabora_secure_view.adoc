== Introduction

Collabora Online allows you to work with all kinds of Collabora office documents directly in your browser. This application can connect to a Collabora Online (or other) server (WOPI-like client) where ownCloud is the WOPI host.

When Collabora Online is properly setup and integrated into ownCloud Server, Secure View functionality is available. Secure View is a mode where users can place limitations on files and folders that are shared.

These limitations include:

* No copying
* No downloading
* No editing
* Watermarking
* Optional printing and exporting to PDF with watermarks included, which can be adjusted

[IMPORTANT]
====
Documents never leave the server when shared with Secure View.

Collabora Online Server opens them and streams the files to the user's browser with watermark applied (much like a video stream). Consequently, there's no way to extract the original document from the browser.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Secure View is enforced on a received share if at least 1 share has Secure View enabled 

If a file or folder has been shared multiple times to different groups with different permissions, Secure View will be enforced if at least 1 received share has Secure View enabled as a result of membership in the group. This restriction propagates to any reshares.

== Prerequisites

* ownCloud *10.3* or above
* _Enterprise Edition_
* {richdocuments-url}[ownCloud Collabora Online] app Version *2.2.0* or above
* Collabora Online Server *4.0.10* or above, set up and integrated

NOTE: This functionality does not work with Public Links.

== Configure ownCloud for Collabora Online / Secure View

To configure ownCloud for the use with Collabora, you need to setup a WOPI server and configure ownCloud to connect with this server. In this section, you can also configure via the command line the Secure View option, the watermark pattern and the Secure View default open action. To do so see the
xref:configuration/server/occ_command.html#collabora-online-secure-view[Collabora related occ command set].

== How to Enable Secure View

To enable _Secure View_, navigate to menu:Settings[Admin > Additional (Admin) > Collabora Online]. At the bottom of the Collabora Online section, enable btn:[Enable Secure View].

Once enabled, default share permissions for all users can, optionally, be enabled. Currently, these default share permissions are:

* *{secure-view-label}*. 
   When enabled, files are shared in Secure View mode. In this mode, all the
   xref:secure-view-mode-limitations[Secure View limitations] are in-effect. 
   When this mode and "_can edit_" are disabled, the share is a regular, "read-only", share.
* *Can print / export PDF*.

NOTE: This option is only visible if btn:[{secure-view-label}] is enabled.

When enabled, this mode allows documents to be can be printed or exported to PDF format — with a watermark — through Collabora Online.
--

NOTE: Admins can specify that all shares are "_Secure View_" by default and that the user has to intentionally change this setting, and vice versa.

When "_{secure-view-label}_" is enabled, any attempts to download the file will be blocked, as exemplified in the screenshot below. Additionally, select, copy, and paste are disabled.
