== Introduction

Collabora Online allows you to work with all kinds of Collabora office documents directly in your browser. This application can connect to a Collabora Online (or other) server (WOPI-like client). ownCloud is the WOPI host.

When Collabora Online is properly setup and integrated into ownCloud Server, Secure View functionality is available. Secure View is a mode where users can place limitations on files and folders that are shared.

These limitations include:

* No copying
* No downloading
* No editing
* Watermarking
* Optional printing and exporting to PDF with watermarks included, which can be adjusted

[IMPORTANT]
====
Documents never leave the server when shared with Secure View.

Collabora Online Server opens them and streams the files to the user's browser with watermark applied (much like a video stream). Consequently, there's no way to extract the original document from the browser.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Secure View gets enforced on received share if at least 1 share has Secure View enabled 

If file or folder has been shared multiple times to different groups with different permissions, Secure View will be enforced if at least 1 received share has Secure View enabled as a result of membership in the group. Restriction further propagates in resharing scenario.
====

Secure View gets enforced on each file or folder that has been shared with Secure View restriction selected. If this is user share, then 

== Prerequisites

* ownCloud *10.3* or above
* _Enterprise Edition_
* {oc-marketplace-url}/apps/richdocuments[ownCloud Collabora Online] app Version *2.2.0* or above
* Collabora Online Server *4.0.10* or above, set up and integrated

== How to Enable Secure View

To enable _Secure View_, navigate to menu:Settings[Admin > Additional (Admin) > Collabora Online]. At the bottom of the Collabora Online section, enable btn:[Enable Secure View].

Once enabled, default share permissions for all users can, optionally, be enabled. Currently, these default share permissions are:

* *{secure-view-label}*. 
   When enabled, files are shared in Secure View mode. In this mode, all the
   xref:secure-view-mode-limitations[Secure View limitations] are in-effect. 
   When this mode and "_can edit_" are disabled, the share is a regular, "read-only", share.
* *Can print / export PDF*.

NOTE: This option is only visible if btn:[{secure-view-label}] is enabled.

When enabled, this mode allows documents to be can be printed or exported to PDF format — with a watermark — through Collabora Online.

NOTE: Admins can specify that all shares are "_Secure View_" by default and that the user has to intentionally change this setting, and vice versa.

When "_{secure-view-label}_" is enabled, any attempts to download the file will be blocked, as exemplified in the screenshot below. Additionally, select, copy, and paste are disabled.
