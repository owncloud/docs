== About

The WOPI (Web Application Open Platform Interface) app, which is bundled with ownCloud Enterprise Edition, is the connector between ownCloud server and {msoffice-online-server-url}[Microsoft Office Online Server].

It allows Microsoft Office Online users to collaboratively work with Office documents in ownCloud in the browser, by connecting ownCloud with your Microsoft Office Online Server via {wopi-protocol-url}[the WOPI protocol]. 
To use it, you need to have a running Microsoft Office Online Server in your data center.

[NOTE]
====
Please bear in mind:

* WOPI is only available for ownCloud enterprise. It _is not available_ in the community version.
* Out-of-the box only the on-premise version of Microsoft Office Online Server is supported.
* This app requires ownCloud Version 10.1 and php 7.1.
