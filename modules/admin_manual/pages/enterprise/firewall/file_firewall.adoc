== Introduction

The File Firewall GUI enables you to manage firewall rule sets. 
You can find it in your ownCloud admin page, under menu:Admin[Security]. 
The File Firewall lets you control access and sharing in fine detail, by creating rules for allowing or denying access restrictions based on: _group_, _upload size_, _client devices_, _IP address_, _time of day_, as well as many more criteria. 
In addition to these restriction options, the File Firewall app also supports rules based on {regex-info-url}[regular expressions].

== How the File Firewall Works

Each firewall rule set consists of one or more conditions. 
If a request matches all of the conditions, in at least one rule set, then the request is blocked by the firewall. 
Otherwise, the request is allowed by the firewall.

NOTE: The File Firewall app cannot lock out administrators from the web interface when rules are misconfigured.

== Using the File Firewall

Figure 1 shows an empty firewall configuration panel. 
Set your logging level to *Blocked Requests Only* for debugging, and create a new rule set by clicking btn:[Add Group]. 
After setting up your rules you must click btn:[Save Rules].

Figure 2 shows two rules. 
The first rule, *No Support outside office hours*, prevents members of the support group from logging into the ownCloud Web interface from 5pm-9am, and also blocks client syncing. 
The second rule prevents members of the "qa-team" group from accessing the Web UI from IP addresses that are outside of the local network.

All other users are not affected, and can log in anytime from anywhere.

=== Available Conditions

==== User Group

The user (is|is not) a member of the selected group.

==== User Agent

The User-Agent of the request (matches|does not match) the given string.

==== User Device

A shortcut for matching all known (`android` | `ios` | `desktop`) sync clients by their User Agent string.

==== Request Time

The time of the request (has to|must not) be in a single range from beginning time to end time.

==== Request URL

The *full page URL* (has to contain) with a given string.

==== Request Type

The request (is a public link share|other) request.

==== Request IP Range (IPv4) and IP Range (IPv6)

The request’s `REMOTE_ADDR` header (is|is not) matching the given IP range.

==== File Size Upload

When a file is uploaded the size has to be (less|greater or equal) to the given size.

==== File Mimetype Upload

Block a request based on the mimetype of a file being uploaded.
The match can be the complete mimetype, part of the mimetype from the start or end of the mimetype.
Negative matches are also supported; i.e., all mimetypes that don’t match the supplied mimetype, or all mimetypes that don’t start or end with the partial mimetype supplied.

The full list of conditions is (File mimetype upload):

* is
* is not
* begins with
* doesn’t begin with
* ends with
* doesn’t end with

NOTE: The complete list of available mimetypes which ownCloud supports is available {supported-mimetype-list-url}[in the ownCloud core source].

==== Common Mimetypes

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
| suffix | mimetype
| avi | video/x-msvideo
| exe | application/x-ms-dos-executable
| flv | video/x-flv
| mp4 | video/mp4
| mkv | video/x-matroska
| msi | application/x-msi
| php | application/x-php

==== System File Tag

One of the parent folders or the file itself (is|is not) tagged with a System tag.

==== Regular Expression

The File Firewall supports regular expressions, allowing you to create custom rules using the following conditions:

* IP Range (IPv4)
* IP Range (IPv6)
* User agent
* User group
* Request URL

You can combine multiple rules into one rule, e.g., if a rule applies to both the support and the qa-team you could write your rule like this:

[source,text]
----
Regular Expression > ^(support|qa-team)$ > is > User group
----

CAUTION: We do not recommend modifying the configuration values directly in your `config.php`.
These use JSON encoding, so the values are difficult to read and a single typo will break all of your rules.

=== Controlling Access to Folders

The easiest way to block access to a folder, starting with ownCloud 9.0,
is to use a system tag. A new rule type was added which allows you to block access to files and folders, where at least one of the parents has a given tag.

Now you just need to add the tag to the folder or file, and then block the tag with the File Firewall. This example blocks access to any folder with the tag "Confidential" from outside access.

Block by System Tag:

----
System file tag:   is       "Confidential"
IP Range (IPv4):   is not   "192.168.1.0/24"
----

=== Logging

Firewall logging can be set to **Off**, **Blocked Requests Only** or **All Requests**

==== Off

The firewall blocks requests according to the defined rules but does not log any of its actions.

==== Blocked Requests Only

The firewall logs blocked requests to the system log at **warning** level.
To see these logs, the system log level must be set to a minimum level of **warning**.

==== All Requests

The firewall logs blocked and successful requests to the system log at **warning** and **info** levels respectively.
To see all these logs, the system log level must be set to a minimum level of **info**.

NOTE: Logging all requests can generate a large amount of log data.
It is recommended to only select all requests for short-term checking of rule settings.

=== Custom Configuration for Branded Clients

If you are using xref:enterprise/clients/creating_branded_apps.adoc[branded ownCloud clients], you may define `firewall.branded_clients` in your `config.php` to identify your branded clients in the firewall *"User Device"* rule.

The configuration is a `User-Agent` => `Device` map. `Device` must be one of the following:

* android
* android_branded
* ios
* ios_branded
* desktop
* desktop_branded

The `User-Agent` is always compared all lowercase. By default the agent is compared with `equals`. 
When a trailing or leading asterisk, `*`, is found, the agent is compared with `starts with` or `ends with`. 
If the agent has both a leading and a trailing `*`, the string must appear anywhere. 
For technical reasons the `User-Agent` string must be at least 4 characters, including wildcards. 
When you build your branded client you have the option to create a custom User Agent.

In this example configuration you need to replace the example User Agent strings, for example `'android_branded'`, with your own User Agent strings:

[source,php]
----
// config.php

'firewall.branded_clients' => array(
  'my ownbrander android user agent string' => 'android_branded',
  'my ownbrander second android user agent string' => 'android_branded',
  'my ownbrander ios user agent string' => 'ios_branded',
  'my ownbrander second ios user agent string' => 'ios_branded',
  'my ownbrander desktop user agent string' => 'desktop_branded',
  'my ownbrander second desktop user agent string' => 'desktop_branded',
),
----

The Web UI dropdown then expands to the following options:

* Android Client - always visible
* iOS Client - always visible
* Desktop Client - always visible
* Android Client (Branded) - visible when at least one `android_branded` is defined
* iOS Client (Branded) - visible when at least one `ios_branded` is defined
* Desktop Client (Branded) - visible when at least one `desktop_branded` is defined
* All branded clients - visible when at least one of `android_branded`,
`ios_branded` or `desktop_branded` is defined
* All non-branded clients - visible when at least one of
`android_branded`, `ios_branded` or `desktop_branded` is defined
* Others (Browsers, etc.) - always visible

Then these options operate this way:

* The `* Client` options only match `android`, `ios` and `desktop` respectively.
* The `* Client (Branded)` options match the `*_branded` agents equivalent.
* `All branded clients` matches: `android_branded`, `ios_branded` and `desktop_branded`
* `All non-branded clients` matches: `android`, `ios` and `desktop`
