== Building a Branded Desktop Sync Client

See https://doc.owncloud.com/branded_clients/[Building Branded ownCloud
Clients] for instructions on building your own branded desktop sync
client, and for setting up an automatic update service.

Your users may run both a branded and un-branded desktop sync client
side-by-side. Both clients run independently of each other, and do not
share account information or files.

== Building a Branded iOS App

Building and distributing your branded iOS ownCloud app involves a large
number of interdependent steps. The process is detailed in the
https://doc.owncloud.com/branded_clients/[Building Branded ownCloud
Clients] manual. Follow these instructions exactly and in order, and you
will have a nice branded iOS app that you can distribute to your users.

== Building a Branded Android App

Building and distributing your branded Android ownCloud app is fairly
simple, and the process is detailed in
https://doc.owncloud.com/branded_clients/[Building Branded ownCloud Clients].
