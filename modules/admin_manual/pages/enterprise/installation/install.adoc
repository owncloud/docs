= Installing & Upgrading ownCloud Enterprise Edition
:toc: right

== Introduction

The recommended method for installing and maintaining your ownCloud
Enterprise edition is with your Linux package manager. Configure your
package manager to use the ownCloud Enterprise repository, import the
signing key, and then install and update ownCloud packages like any
other software package.

Please refer to the `README - ownCloud Package Installation.txt`
document in your account at
https://customer.owncloud.com/owncloud/[Customer.owncloud.com]
account for instructions on setting up your Linux package manager.

After you have completed your initial installation of ownCloud as detailed in the README, 
follow the instructions in xref:installation/installation_wizard.adoc[The Installation Wizard] 
to finish setting up ownCloud. To upgrade your Enterprise server, refer to 
xref:maintenance/upgrade.adoc[How to Upgrade Your ownCloud Server].

== Manual Installation

Download the ownCloud archive from your account at
https://customer.owncloud.com/owncloud, then follow the instructions at
xref:installation/manual_installation.adoc[Manual Installation on Linux].

=== SELinux

Linux distributions that use SELinux need to take some extra steps so
that ownCloud will operate correctly under SELinux. Please see
xref:installation/selinux_configuration.adoc[SELinux Configuration] for some recommended
configurations.

== License Keys

=== Introduction

Youâ€™ll need to install a license key to use ownCloud Enterprise Edition.
There are two types of license keys: one is a free 30-day trial key. The
other is a full license key for Enterprise customers.

You can https://owncloud.com/download/[download and try ownCloud Enterprise for 30 days for free],
which auto-generates a free 30-day key. When this key expires your ownCloud installation is not removed, so
when you become an Enterprise customer you can enter your new key to
regain access. See https://owncloud.com/how-to-buy-owncloud/[How to Buy ownCloud]
for sales and contact information.

=== Configuration

Once you get your Enterprise license key, it needs to be copied to your
ownCloud configuration file, `config/config.php` file like this example:

[source,php]
----
'license-key' => 'test-20150101-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX-YYYYYY',
----

Each running instance of ownCloud requires a license key. Keys will work
across upgrades without issue, so new keys will not be required when you
upgrade your ownCloud Enterprise to a new version.

== Supported ownCloud Enterprise Edition Apps

See xref:installation/apps_supported.adoc[Supported Apps in ownCloud] for a list of supported apps.

NOTE: 3rd party and unsupported apps must be disabled before performing a system upgrade. Then install the upgraded versions, and after the upgrade is complete re-enable them.
