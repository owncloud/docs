:toc: right

== Introduction

Follow this guide to use Microsoft OneDrive as an external storage option in ownCloud.

== Create an Application Configuration

To create a new application:

* Open https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/ in your browser of choice and click "__Create App__".
* Under "__Properties__", set the applicationâ€™s name.
* Click "__Create__".

With the application created, you can then add a range of further
settings. However, only a few of them are required for use with
ownCloud.

=== Application Password

Under "__Application Secrets__", click "__Generate New Password__",
which generates a password and displays it in a popup window. It is
required later during when configuring a mount point.

Copy the password to your preferred password manager, as it is only displayed *once*.

=== Redirect URLs

Under "__Platforms__", click "__Add Platform__" and choose
"__Web__" in the popup window which appears. Only one redirect URL
field is visible at first, so click "__Add URL__" to add another one.

With two fields available, add two redirect URLs; one for
`settings/admin` and one for `settings/personal`, as you can see in the
image below.

=== Application Permissions

Under "__Microsoft Graph Permissions__", click "__Add__" next to
"__Application Permissions__". This opens a popup window where you can
choose the required permissions. Add a least the following four:

* `Files.Read.All`
* `Files.ReadWrite.All`
* `IdentityRiskEvent.Read.All`
* `User.Read.All`

With those settings added, click "__Save__", located right at the
bottom of the page.

== Configure a Mount Point in ownCloud

You can add as many OneDrive mount points as you want. To do so:

1.  Add a new storage, selecting "One Drive" for external storage.
2.  Set the credentials of your OneDrive application, and then accept
the permissions.
3.  If everything is accepted, the mount points should appear, with a
green status icon on the far left-hand side.

To be able to use the occ command `files_onedrive:subscribe`, you need
to have the variable `overwrite.cli.url` set in `config/config.php`, as
in this example:

[source,php]
----
'overwrite.cli.url' => 'https://example.org:63984/index.php',
----

The HTTPS prefix, port, and `/index.php` suffix are mandatory.
