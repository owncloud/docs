== Introduction

The https://marketplace.owncloud.com/apps/windows_network_drive[External Storage: Windows Network Drives app]
creates a control panel in your Admin page for seamlessly integrating Windows and Samba/CIFS shared network
drives as external storages.

Any Windows file share and Samba servers on Linux and other Unix-type
operating systems use the SMB/CIFS file-sharing protocol. The files and
directories on the SMB/CIFS server will be visible on your Files page
just like your other ownCloud files and folders.

They are labeled with a little four-pane Windows-style icon, and the
left pane of your Files page includes a Windows Network Drive filter.
Figure 1 shows a new Windows Network Drive share marked with red
warnings.

These indicate that ownCloud cannot connect to the share because it
requires the user to login, it is not available, or there is an error in
the configuration.

image:enterprise/external_storage/wnd-1.png[Windows Network Drive share on your Files page]

TIP: For more information on SMB/CIFS in ownCloud, refer to xref:configuration/files/external_storage/smb.adoc[the Samba file server configuration documentation].

TIP: If you encounter errors with `NT_STATUS_REVISION_MISMATCH`, please get in touch with support@owncloud.com.

Files are synchronized bi-directionally, and you can create, upload, and
delete files and folders. ownCloud server admins can create Windows
Network Drive mounts and optionally allow users to set up their own
personal Windows Network Drive mounts.

Depending on the authentication method, passwords for each mount are
encrypted and stored in the ownCloud database, using a long random
secret key stored in `config.php`, which allows ownCloud to access the
shares when the users who own the mounts are not logged in. Or,
passwords are not stored and available only for the current session,
which adds security.

== Installation

Install the https://marketplace.owncloud.com/apps/windows_network_drive[External Storage: Windows Network Drives app]
from the ownCloud Market App or ownCloud Marketplace.
To make it work, a few  dependencies have to be installed.

* A Samba client. This is included in all Linux distributions.
On Debian, Ubuntu, and other Debian derivatives it is called `smbclient`.
On SUSE, Red Hat, CentOS, and other Red Hat derivatives it is `samba-client`.
* `php-smbclient` (version 0.8.0+). It should be included in most Linux distributions.
You can use https://github.com/eduardok/libsmbclient-php[eduardok/libsmbclient-php],
if your distribution does not provide it.
* `which` and `stdbuf`. These should be included in most Linux distributions.

=== Example

Assuming that your ownCloud installation is on Ubuntu, then the
following commands will install the required dependencies:

[source,console]
----
# Install core packages
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install -y smbclient php-smbclient coreutils
----

Other method using PECL is:

[source,console]
----
# Install php-smbclient using PECL
pecl install smbclient

# Install it from source
git clone git://github.com/eduardok/libsmbclient-php.git
cd libsmbclient-php ; phpize
./configure
make
sudo make install
----

[NOTE]
====
Regardless of the method you use, remember to check if an smbclient.ini
file exists in `/etc/php/<your php version>/mods-available` and contains
the following line:

----
extension="smbclient.so"
----
====

If so, then make it available via by running the following command:

----
sudo phpenmod -v ALL smbclient
----

== Configuration

=== Enabling External Storage

To enable external storage go to menu:Settings[Storage (in the admin section)], as the ownCloud administrator.
Tick the checkbox to enable external storage.

=== Creating a New Share

When you create a new WND share you need three things:

* The login credentials for the share
* The server address, the share name; and
* The folder you want to connect to

[CAUTION]
.Treat all the parameters as being case-sensitive.
====
Although some parts of the app might work properly, regardless of case, other parts might have problems if case isn't respected.
====

1.  Enter the ownCloud mount point for your new WND share. This must not
be an existing folder.
2.  Then select your authentication method; See enterprise_only_auth for
complete information on the five available authentication methods.

image:enterprise/external_storage/wnd-2.png[Figure 2: WND mountpoint and authorization
credentials.]

1.  Enter the address of the server that contains the WND share.
2.  The Windows share name.
3.  The root folder of the share. This is the folder name, or the
`$user` variable for user's home directories. Note that the LDAP
`Internal Username Attribute` must be set to the `samaccountname` for
either the share or the root to work, and the user's home directory
needs to match the `samaccountname`. (See xref:configuration/user/user_auth_ldap.adoc[User Authentication with LDAP].)
4.  Login credentials.
5.  Select users or groups with access to the share. The default is all
users.
6.  Click the gear icon for additional mount options. Note that previews
are enabled by default, while sharing is not (see figure 2). Sharing is
not available for all authorization methods; see enterprise_only_auth.
For large storages with many files, you may want to disable previews,
because this can significantly increase performance.

image:enterprise/external_storage/wnd-3.png[Figure 3: WND server, credentials, and
additional mount options]

Your changes are saved automatically.

NOTE: When you create a new mountpoint using Login credentials, you must log out of ownCloud and then log back in so you can access the share. You only have to do this the first time.

=== Personal WND Mounts

NOTE: Be aware that by default changes in the file system won't be transferred to ownCloud (use case: Sync client) and a **service account with access to shares** is required for ownCloud to receive changes from the personal mounts.

Users create their own WND mounts on their Personal pages. These are
created the same way as Admin-created shares. Users have four options
for login credentials:

* Username and password
* Log-in credentials, save in session
* Log-in credentials, save in database
* Global credentials

=== Windows Network Drive Listener

[IMPORTANT]
====
ownCloud requires at least {samba-478-url}[Samba version 4.7.8] or {samba-481-url}[Samba 4.8.1] on the ownCloud server, when:

. The Windows Network Drive Listener is used; *and*
. The remote Windows/Samba file server requires at least {smb2-url}[version 2.0 of the SMB protocol].

The xref:{wnd-config-path}[Windows Network Drive Listener] only supports version 1 of the SMB protocol with earlier Samba versions.

*Here's Why*

A {samba-url}[Samba] server, often a Microsoft Windows Server, can enforce the minimum and maximum protocol versions used by connecting clients.
However, in light of {wannacry-ransomware-attack-url}[the WannaCry ransomware attack], {msft-security-bulletin-ms17-010-url}[Microsoft patched Windows Server] to only allow SMB2 protocol by default (as SMB1 is insecure).

The ownCloud windows network drive listener utilizes the SMB notification feature which works well with SMB1 in conjunction with most Samba versions.
However, when the minimum protocol a server accepts is SMB2, ownCloud require Samba 4.7.8+ (4.8+ etc.) to be able to properly work, as prior versions of Samba had a bug that break this feature.
====

The SMB protocol supports registering for notifications of file changes
on remote Windows SMB storage servers. Notifications are more efficient
than polling for changes, as polling requires scanning the whole SMB
storage. ownCloud supports SMB notifications with an `occ` command,
`occ wnd:listen`.

NOTE: The notifier only works with remote storage on Windows servers. It does not work reliably with Linux servers due to technical limitations.

Your `smbclient` version needs to be 4.x, as older versions do not
support notifications. The ownCloud server needs to know about changes
to files on integrated storage so that the changed files will be synced
to the ownCloud server, and to desktop sync clients.

Files changed through the ownCloud Web Interface, or sync clients are
automatically updated in the ownCloud file cache, but this is not
possible when files are changed directly on remote SMB storage mounts.

To create a new SMB notification, start a listener on your ownCloud
server with `occ wnd:listen`. The listener marks changed files, and a
background job updates the file metadata.



=== Setting Up the WND Listener

The WND listener for ownCloud 10 includes two different commands that need to be executed:

* xref:wnd-listen[wnd:listen]
* xref:wndprocess-queue[wnd:process-queue]

=== wnd:listen

This command listens and stores notifications in the database coming
from one specific host and share. It is intended to be run as a service.
The command requires the host and share, which the listener will listen
to, and the Windows/Samba account that will listen. The command does not
produce any output by default, unless errors happen.

NOTE: You can increase the command's verbosity by using `-vvv`. Doing so displays what the listener is doing, including a timestamp and the notifications received. Although the exact permissions required for the Windows account are unknown, read-only should be enough.

The simplest way to start the `wnd:listen` process manually, perhaps for
initial testing, is as follows

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} wnd:listen <host> <share> <username>
----

The password is an optional parameter and you'll be asked for it if you
didn't provide it, as in the example above. In order to start the
`wnd:listen` without any user interaction, provide the password as the
user's 4th parameter, as in the following example:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} wnd:listen <host> <share> <username> <password>
----

For additional options to provide the password, check xref:password-options[Password Options]

Note that in any case there won't be any processing of the password by
default. This means that spaces or newline chars won't be removed unless
explicitly told. Use the `--password-trim` option in those cases.

You should be able to run any of those commands, and/or wrap them into a
systemd service or any other startup service, so that the `wnd:listen`
command is automatically started during boot, if you need it.

=== wnd:process-queue

This command processes the stored notifications for a given host and
share. This process is intended to be run periodically as a Cron job, or
via a similar mechanism. The command will process the notifications
stored by the `wnd:listen` process, showing only errors by default. If
you need more information, increase the verbosity by calling
`wnd:process-queue -vvv`.

As a simple example, you can check the following:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} wnd:process-queue <host> <share>
----

You can run that command, even if there are no notifications to be
processed.

As said, you can wrap that command in a Cron job so it's run every 5
minutes for example.

=== WND Listener Configuration

Create a service for systemd following the instructions below that checks the share for changes:

* For each WND mount point distinguished by a SERVER - SHARE pair:
** Place one copy of a file with following content under `/etc/systemd/system/owncloud-wnd-listen-SERVER-SHARE.service`
** Replace the all upper case words `SERVER`, `SHARE`, `USER` and `PASSWORD` in both, the **filename** and in the **contents** below with their respective values.
** Take care to also adjust the paths in `WorkingDirectory` and `ExecStart` according to your installation.
** Password: Create a file readable only by the www-data and outside the directories handled by apache (let's suppose in /tmp/mypass). The file must contain only the password for the share. In this example our file is: "/tmp/mypass". The listener will read the contents of the file and use them as the password for the account. This way, only root and the apache user should have access to the password.
** "--password-trim" removes blank characters from the password file added by 3rdparty software or other services.

----

=== WND Process Queue Configuration

Create or add a `crontab` file in `/etc/cron.d/oc-wnd-process-queue`.

* Make a `crontab` entry to run a script iterating over all `SERVER SHARE` pairs with an appropriate `occ wnd:process-queue` command. 
  The commands must be **strictly sequential**. 
  This can be done by using `flock -n` and tuning the `-c` parameter of `occ wnd:process-queue`

[source,console]
----
* * * * *  sudo -u www-data /usr/bin/php /var/www/owncloud/occ wnd:process-queue <HOST> <SHARE>
----


=== Execution Serialization

Parallel runs of `wnd:process-queue` might lead to a user lockout.
The reason for this is that several `wnd:process-queue` might use the same wrong password because it hasn't been updated by the time they fetch it.

It's recommended to force the execution serialization of the `wnd:process-queue` command. You might want to use {anacron-examples}[Anacron], which seems to have an option for this scenario, or wrap the command with {shell-flock-intro}[flock].

If you need to serialize the execution of the `wnd:process-queue`, check the following example with {shell-flock-intro}[flock]

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
flock -n /my/lock/file {occ-command-example-prefix} wnd:process-queue <host> <share>
----

In that case, flock will try get the lock of that file and won't run the command if it isn't possible. 
For our case, and considering that file isn't being used by any other process, it will run only one `wnd:process-queue` at a time. 
If someone tries to run the same command a second time while the previous one is running, the second will fail and won't be executed. 
Check {flock-docs-url}[flock's documentation] for details and other options.


== Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues using Windows network drive, then try the following troubleshooting steps:

First check the connection to the share by using {smbclient-manpage-url}[smbclient] on the command line of the ownCloud server.
Here is an example:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
smbclient -U Username -L //Servername
----

Take the example of attempting to connect to the share named `MyData` using `occ wnd:listen`. Running the following command would work:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} wnd:listen MyHost MyData svc_owncloud password
----

NOTE: The command is case sensitive, and that it must match the information from the mount point configuration.

=== libsmbclient Issues

If your Linux distribution ships with `libsmbclient 3.x`, which is included in the Samba client, you may need to set up the `HOME` variable in Apache to prevent a segmentation fault. 
If you have `libsmbclient 4.1.6` and higher it doesn't seem to be an issue, so you won't have to change your `HOME` variable. 
To set up the `HOME` variable on Ubuntu, modify the `/etc/apache2/envvars` file:

----
unset HOME
export HOME=/var/www
----

In Red Hat/CentOS, modify the `/etc/sysconfig/httpd` file and add the following line to set the HOME variable in Apache:

----
export HOME=/usr/share/httpd
----

By default, CentOS has activated SELinux, and the `httpd` process can not make outgoing network connections. 
This will cause problems with the `curl`, `ldap` and `samba` libraries. 
You'll need to get around this to make this work. First, check the status:

----
getsebool -a | grep httpd
httpd_can_network_connect --> off
----

Then enable support for network connections:

----
setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1
----

In openSUSE, modify the `/usr/sbin/start_apache2` file:

----
export HOME=/var/lib/apache2
----

Restart Apache, open your ownCloud Admin page and start creating SMB/CIFS mounts.

=== Basic Setup for One ownCloud Server

First, go to the admin settings and set up the required WND mounts.
Be aware though, that there are some limitations.
These are:

* We need access to the Windows account password for the mounts to update the file cache properly.
This means that "__login credentials, saved in session__" won't work with the listener.
"__login credentials, saved in DB__" should work and could be the best replacement.
* The `$user` placeholder in the share, such as
`//host/$user/path/to/root`, for providing a share which is accessible
per/user won't work with the listener. This is because the listener
won't scale, as you'll need to setup one listener per/share. As a
result, you'll end up with too many listeners. An alternative is to
provide a common share for the users and use the `$user` placeholder in
the root, such as `//host/share/$user/folder`.

Second, start the `wnd:listen` process if it's not already started,
ideally running it as a service. If it isn't running, no notification
are stored. The listener stores the notifications. Any change in the
mount point configuration, such as adding or removing new mounts, and
logins by new users, won't affect the behavior, so there is no need to
restart the listener in those cases.

In case you have several mount point configurations, note that each
listener attaches to one host and share. If there are several mount
configurations targeting different shares, you'll need to spawn one
listener for each. For example, if you have one configuration with
`10.0.0.2/share1` and another with `10.0.0.2/share2`, you'll need to
spawn 2 listeners, one for the first configuration and another for the
second.

Third, run the `wnd:process-queue` periodically, usually via xref:configuration/server/background_jobs_configuration.adoc#cron-jobs[a Cron job]. 
The command processes all the stored
notifications for a specific host and share. If you have several, you
could set up several Cron jobs, one for each host and share with
different intervals, depending on the load or update urgency. As a
simple example, you could run the command every 2 minutes for one server
and every 5 minutes for another.

As said, the command processes all the stored notifications, squeeze
them and scan the resulting folders. The process might crash if there
are too many notifications, or if it has too many storages to update.
The `--chunk-size` option will help by making the command process all
the notifications in buckets of that size.

On the one hand the memory usage is reduced, on the other hand there is
more network activity. We recommend using the option with a value high
enough to process a large number of notifications, but not so large to
crash the process. Between 200 and 500 should be fine, and we'll likely
process all the notifications in one go.

=== Password Options

There are several ways to supply a password:

. Interactively in response to a password prompt.
+
[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} wnd:listen <host> <share> <username>
----
. Sent as a parameter to the command.
+
[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} wnd:listen <host> <share> <username> <password>
----
. Read from a file, using the `--password-file` switch to specify the
file to read from. Note that the password must be in plain text inside
the file, and neither spaces nor newline characters will be removed from
the file by default, unless the `--pasword-trim` option is added. The
password file must be readable by the apache user (or www-data)
+
[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} wnd:listen <host> <share> <username> \
  --password-file=/my/secret/password/file
----
+
[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} wnd:listen <host> <share> <username> \
  --password-file=/my/secret/password/file --password-trim
----

NOTE: If you use the `--password-file` switch, the entire contents of the file will be used for the password, so please be careful with newlines.

IMPORTANT: If using `--password-file` make sure that the file is only readable by the apache / www-data user and inaccessible from the web. This prevents tampering or leaking of the information. The password won't be leaked to any other user using `ps`.

. Using 3rd party software to store and fetch the password. When using
this option, the 3rd party app needs to show the password as plaintext
on standard output.

=== 3rd Party Software Examples

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
cat /tmp/plainpass | {occ-command-example-prefix} wnd:listen <host> <share> <username> --password-file=-
----

This provides a bit more security because the `/tmp/plainpass` password
should be owned by root and only root should be able to read the file
(0400 permissions); Apache, particularly, shouldn't be able to read it.
It's expected that root will be the one to run this command.

[source,console]
----
base64 -d /tmp/encodedpass | sudo -u www-data \
  ./occ wnd:listen <host> <share> <username> --password-file=-
----

Similar to the previous example, but this time the contents are encoded
in https://www.base64decode.org/[Base64 format]
(there's not much security, but it has additional obfuscation).

Third party password managers can also be integrated. The only
requirement is that they have to provide the password in plain text
somehow. If not, additional operations might be required to get the
password as plain text and inject it in the listener.

As an example:

You can use "pass" as a password manager.
You can go through http://xmodulo.com/manage-passwords-command-line-linux.html
to setup the keyring for whoever will fetch the password (probably root) and then use something like the following

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
pass the-password-name | {occ-command-example-prefix} wnd:listen <host> <share> <username> --password-file=-
----

=== Password Option Precedence

If both the argument and the option are passed, e.g.,
`occ wnd:listen <host> <share> <username> <password> --password-file=/tmp/pass`,
then the `--password-file` option will take precedence.

=== Optimizing wnd:process-queue

NOTE: Do not use this option if the process-queue is fast enough. The option has some drawbacks,
specifically regarding password changes in the backend.

`wnd:process-queue` creates all the storages that need to be updated
from scratch. To do so, we need to fetch all the users from all the
backends (currently only the ones that have logged in at least once
because the others won't have the storages that we'll need updates).

To optimize this, `wnd:process-queue` make use of two switches:
`–serializer-type` and `–serializer-params`. These serialize
storages for later use, so that future executions don't need to fetch
the users, saving precious time — especially for large organizations.

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
| Switch | Allowed Values
| `--serializer-type` | `file`. Other valid values may be added in the future, as more
implementations are requested.
| `--serializer-params` 
| Depends on `--serializer-type`, because those will be the parameters that the chosen serializer will use. 
For the `file` serializer, you need to provide a file location in the host FS where the storages will be serialized.
You can use `--serializer-params file=/tmp/file` as an example.
|===

While the specific behavior will depend on the serializer
implementation, the overall behavior can be simplified as follows:

If the serializer's data source (such as _a file_, _a database table_,
or some _Redis keys_) has storage data, it uses that data to create the
storages; otherwise, it creates the storages from scratch.

After the storages are created, notifications are processed for the
storages. If the storages have been created from scratch, those storages
are written in the data source so that they can be read on the next run.

NOTE: It's imperative to periodically clean up the data source to fetch fresh data, such as for
new storages and updated passwords. There isn't a generic command to do this from ownCloud,
because it depends on the specific serializer type. Though this option could be provided at some point if requested.

=== The File Serializer

The file serializer is a serializer implementation that can be used with
the `wnd:process-queue` command. It requires an additional parameter
where you can specify the location of the file containing the serialized
storages.

There are several things you should know about this serializer:

* The generated file contains the encrypted passwords for accessing the
backend. This is necessary in order to avoid re-fetching the user
information, when next accessing the storages.
* The generated file is intended to be readable and writable *only* for
the web server user. Other users shouldn't have access to this file. Do
not manually edit the file. You can remove the file if it contains
obsolete information.

=== Usage Recommendations

==== Number of Serializers

Only one file serializer should be used per server and share, as the
serialized file has to be per server and share. Consider the following
usage scenario:

* If you have three shares: `10.0.2.2/share1`, `10.0.2.2/share2`, and
`10.0.10.20/share2`, then you should use three different calls to
`wnd:process-queue`, changing the target file for the serializer for
each one.

Since the serialized file has to be per server and share, the serialized
file has some checks to prevent misuse. Specifically, if we detect
you're trying to read the storages for another server and share from the
file, the contents of the file won't be read and will fallback to
creating the storage from scratch. At this point, we'll then update the
contents of that file with the new storage.

Doing so, though, creates unneeded competition, where several
process-queue will compete for the serializer file. For example, let's
say that you have two process-queues targeting the same serializer file.
After the first process creates the file the second process will notice
that the file is no longer available. As a result, it will recreate the
file with new content.

At this point the first process runs again and notices that the file
isn't available and recreate the file again. When this happens, the
serializer file's purpose isn't fulfilled As a result, we recommend the
use of a different file per server and share.

==== File Clean Up

The file will need to cleaned up from time to time. The easiest way to
do this is to remove the file when it is no longer needed. The file will
be regenerated with fresh data the next execution if the serializer
option is set.

=== Interaction Between Listener and Windows Password Lockout

Windows supports
https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd277400.aspx[password lockout policies].
If one is enabled on the server where an ownCloud
share is located, and a user fails to enter their password correctly
several times, they may be locked out and unable to access the share.

This is https://github.com/owncloud/Windows_network_drive/issues/94[a known issue]
that prevents these two inter-operating correctly.
Currently, the only viable solution is to ignore that feature and use
the `wnd:listen` and `wnd:process-queue`, without the serializer
options.


=== Multiple Server Setup

Setups with several servers might have some difficulties in some
scenarios:

* The `wnd:listen` component _might_ be duplicated among several
servers. This shouldn't cause a problem, depending on the limitations of
the underlying database engine. The supported database engines should be
able to handle concurrent access and de-duplication.
* The `wnd:process-queue` _should_ also be able to run from any server,
however limitations for concurrent executions still apply. As a result,
you might need to serialized command execution of the
`wnd:process-queue` among the servers (to avoid for the password
lockout), which might not be possible or difficult to achieve. You might
want to execute the command from just one specific server in this case.
* `wnd:process-queue` + serializer. First, check the above section to
know the interactions with the password lockout. Right now, the only
option you have to set it up is to store the target file in a common
location for all the server. We might need to provide a specific
serializer for this scenario (based on Redis or DB)

=== Basic Command Execution Examples

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} `wnd:listen` host share username password

{occ-command-example-prefix} `wnd:process-queue` host share

{occ-command-example-prefix} `wnd:process-queue` host share -c 500 \
    --serializer-type file \
    --serializer-params file=/opt/oc/store

    --serializer-type File \
    --serializer-params file=/opt/oc/store2
----

To set it up, make sure the listener is running as a system service:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} `wnd:listen` host share username password
----

Setup a Cron job or similar with something like the following two
commands:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} wnd:process-queue host share -c 500 \
    --serializer-type file \
    --serializer-params file=/opt/oc/store1

rm -f /opt/oc/store1 # With a different schedule
----

The first run will create the `/opt/oc/store1` with the serialized
storages, the rest of the executions will use that file. The second Cron
job, the one removing the file, will force the `wnd:process-queue` to
refresh the data.

It's intended to be run in a different schedule, so there are several
executions of the `wnd:process-queue` fetching the data from the file.
Note that the file can be removed manually at any time if it's needed
(for example, the admin has reset some passwords, or has been notified
about password changing).
