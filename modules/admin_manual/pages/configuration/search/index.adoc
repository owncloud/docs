== Introduction

The {search_elastic-app-url}[Full Text Search app] integrates full text search into ownCloud, powered by Elasticsearch.

== Prerequisites

A fully functioning Elasticsearch server with the {ingest-attachment-processor-url}[ingest-attachment processor] must be present.
The ingest-attachment processor lets Elasticsearch extract file attachments in common formats, such as PPT, XLS, and PDF.

To install the processor, from your Elasticsearch installation directory, run the following command:

[source=console]
----
bin/elasticsearch-plugin install ingest-attachment
service elasticsearch restart
----

NOTE: Only Elasticsearch version 5.6 is fully supported by version 1.0.0 of the Full Text Search app. 
Version 7 of Elasticsearch will be supported by version 2.0.0 of the app.

== Install and Configure the Full Text Search App

To install the app, use the Marketplace app on your ownCloud server or proceed manually:

. Download and extract the tarball of {search_elastic-app-url}[the Full Text Search app] to the apps directory (or xref:installation/apps_management_installation.adoc#using-custom-app-directories[custom apps directory]) of your ownCloud instance.
. Use xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#apps-commands[the occ app:enable command] to enable the search_elastic application.

To configure the Full Text Search, go to menu:Settings[Search (admin)] and set the hostname (or IP address) and port of the Elasticsearch server and click btn:["Setup index"].

TIP: The index can also be managed from the command line, via the xref:configuration/server/occ_commands/core_commands/full_text_search_commands.adoc[occ search:index commands]. 
These commands let administrators _create_, _rebuild_, _reset_, and _update_ the search index.

== Known Limitations

Currently, the app has the following known limitations:

* Files are shown twice in search results when searching by filename.
* If a shared file is renamed by the sharee (share receiver), the sharee cannot find the file using the new filename.
* If the search query doesn't match the _start_ of at least one word in an available file's name, no results are returned.
* Search results are not updated when a text file is rolled back to an earlier version.
* The app does not return results for federated share files.
* The app only works with the default encryption module "_Master Key_".
