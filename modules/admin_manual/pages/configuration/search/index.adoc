== Introduction

The {search_elastic-app-url}[search_elastic app] integrates full text search into ownCloud, powered by Elasticsearch.

== Prerequisites

There is only one pre-requisite for the search_elastic app, and thatâ€™s a fully functioning Elasticsearch server with the {ingest-attachment-processor-url}[ingest-attachment processor] to be present.
The ingest-attachment processor lets Elasticsearch extract file attachments in common formats, such as PPT, XLS, and PDF.

To install the processor, from your Elasticsearch installation directory, run the following command:

[source=console]
----
bin/elasticsearch-plugin install ingest-attachment
service elasticsearch restart
----

NOTE: Only Elasticsearch version 5.6 is fully supported. 
Versions 6 and 7 are yet to be supported.

== Install and Configure the search_elastic App

To install the search_elastic app:

. Download and extract the tarball of {search_elastic-app-url}[the latest release] of the search_elastic app to the apps directory (or xref:installation/apps_management_installation.adoc#using-custom-app-directories[custom apps directory]) of your ownCloud instance.
. Use xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#apps-commands[the occ app:enable command] to enable the search_elastic application.
. Go to menu:Settings[Search (admin)] and set the hostname (or IP address) and port of the Elasticsearch server and click btn:["Reset Index"].

TIP: The index can also be managed from the command-line, via xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#search[the occ search:index commands]. 
The commands let administrators _create_, _rebuild_, _reset_, and _update_ the search index.

== Known Limitations

Currently, there are several known limitations to the app; these are:

* Files are shown twice in search results when searching by filename.
* If a shared file is renamed by the sharee (share receiver), the sharee cannot find the file using the new filename.
* If the search query doesn't match the _start_ of at least one word in an available file's name, no results are returned.
* Search results are not updated when a text file is rolled back to an earlier version.
* The app does not return results for federated share files.
* The app only works with the default encryption module "_Master Key_".
