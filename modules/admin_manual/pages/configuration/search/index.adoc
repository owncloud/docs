== Introduction

The {search_elastic-app-url}[Full Text Search app] integrates full text search into ownCloud, powered by Elasticsearch. This allows users to search not only for file names but also within files stored in ownCloud.

== Prerequisites

A fully functioning {elastic-search-url}[Elasticsearch server] with the ingest-attachment processor must be present.

NOTE: Version 1.0.0 of the Full Text Search app only works with Elasticsearch version 5.6. With version 2.0.0 of the app, Elasticsearch version 7 is supported and required.

The ingest-attachment processor lets Elasticsearch extract file attachments in common formats. 
To install the processor, run the following command from your Elasticsearch installation directory:

[source=console]
----
bin/elasticsearch-plugin install ingest-attachment
service elasticsearch restart
----

== Install and Configure the Full Text Search App

To install the app, use the Marketplace app on your ownCloud server or proceed manually:

. Download and extract the tarball of {search_elastic-app-url}[the Full Text Search app] to the apps directory (or xref:installation/apps_management_installation.adoc#using-custom-app-directories[custom apps directory]) of your ownCloud instance.
. Use the xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#apps-commands[occ app:enable] to enable the search_elastic application.

To configure the Full Text Search, go to menu:admin[Settings > Search] and set the hostname (or IP address) and port of the Elasticsearch server and click btn:["Setup index"].

TIP: The index can also be managed from the command line, via the xref:configuration/server/occ_commands/core_commands/full_text_search_commands.adoc[occ search:index commands].

These commands let administrators _create_, _rebuild_, _reset_, and _update_ the search index.

To find out more about usage, check out the section in the User Manual: xref:user_manual:/files/webgui/search.adoc[Search & Full Text Search].

== Known Limitations

Currently, the app has the following known limitations:

* If a shared file is renamed by the sharee (share receiver), the sharee cannot find the file using the new filename.
* Search results are not updated when a text file is rolled back to an earlier version.
* The app does not return results for federated share files.
* The app only works with the default encryption module "_Master Key_".
