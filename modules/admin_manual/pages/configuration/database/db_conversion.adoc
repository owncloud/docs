= Converting Database Type
:toc: right

== Introduction

SQLite is good for testing ownCloud, as well as small, single-user,
ownCloud servers. But, *it does not scale* for large, multi-user sites.
If you have an existing ownCloud installation which uses SQLite, and you
want to convert to a better performing database, such as _MySQL_,
_MariaDB_ or _PostgreSQL_, you can use
the ownCloud command line tool: xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#database-conversion[occ].

NOTE: ownCloud Enterprise edition does not support SQLite.

== Preparation

Add the following to your ownCloud `config/config.php`:

[source,php]
----
'mysql.utf8mb4' => true,
----

Add, or adjust, the following in `/etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf`:

NOTE: You can do the same for MySQL by replacing `mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf` with `mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf`.

[source,mysql]
----
key_buffer_size         = 32M
table_cache             = 400
query_cache_size        = 128M
#in InnoDB:
innodb_flush_method=O_DIRECT
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=1
innodb_log_file_size=256M
innodb_log_buffer_size = 128M
innodb_buffer_pool_size=2048M
innodb_buffer_pool_instances=3
innodb_read_io_threads=4
innodb_write_io_threads=4
innodb_io_capacity = 500
innodb_thread_concurrency=2
innodb_file_format=Barracuda
innodb_file_per_table=ON
innodb_large_prefix = 1
character-set-server  = utf8mb4
collation-server      = utf8mb4_general_ci
----

== Restart the Database Server

When you have changed the database parameters, restart your database by running following command:

[source,console]
----
sudo service mysql restart
----

== Run the conversion

After you have restarted the database, run the following occ command in your ownCloud root folder, to convert the database to the new format:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} db:convert-type [options] type username hostname database
----

[NOTE]
====
The converter searches for apps in your configured app folders and uses the schema definitions in the apps to create the new table.
As a result, tables of removed apps will not be converted â€” even with option `--all-apps`
For example:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} db:convert-type --all-apps mysql oc_mysql_user 127.0.0.1 new_db_name
----
====

To successfully proceed with the conversion, you must type `yes` when
prompted with the question `Continue with the conversion?` On success
the converter will automatically configure the new database in your
ownCloud config `config.php`.

== Unconvertible Tables

If you updated your ownCloud installation then the old tables, which are
not used anymore, might still exist. The converter will tell you which
ones.

[source,console]
----
The following tables will not be converted:
  oc_permissions
----

You can ignore these tables. Here is a list of known old tables:

* `oc_calendar_calendars`
* `oc_calendar_objects`
* `oc_calendar_share_calendar`
* `oc_calendar_share_event`
* `oc_fscache`
* `oc_log`
* `oc_media_albums`
* `oc_media_artists`
* `oc_media_sessions`
* `oc_media_songs`
* `oc_media_users`
* `oc_permissions`
* `oc_queuedtasks`
* `oc_sharing`
