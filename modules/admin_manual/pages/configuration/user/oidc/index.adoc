== Introduction

"OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It allows Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an interoperable and REST-like manner.
OpenID Connect allows clients of all types, including Web-based, mobile, and JavaScript clients, to request and receive information about authenticated sessions and end-users. The specification suite is extensible, allowing participants to use optional features such as encryption of identity data, discovery of OpenID Providers, and session management, when it makes sense for them."

== Prerequisites

A distributed Memcache setup is required to operate this app - such as Redis or Memcached properly.
Please follow xref:configuration/server/caching_configuration.adoc[the documentation] on how to set up caching.

== Code Flow

== Configure ownCloud

Please refer to xref:configuration/server/config_sample_php_parameters.adoc#oidc-configuration[the OIDC configuration example] in the sample configuration documentation for how to configure ownCloud to work with OIDC.

== Setup Within the OpenID Provider

When registering ownCloud as and OpenID Client, use `https://cloud.example.net/index.php/apps/openidconnect/redirect` as the redirect URL.
In case {openid-connect-frontchannel-logout-url}[OpenID Connect Front-Channel Logout 1.0] is supported, please enter `https://cloud.example.net/index.php/apps/openidconnect/logout` as the logout URL within the client registration of the OpenID Provider.

== Setup Service Discovery

To allow other clients to use OpenID Connect when talking to ownCloud, please set up a redirect on the webserver to point `.well-known/openid-configuration` to `/index.php/apps/openidconnect/config`.
Here is an .htaccess example

RewriteRule ^\.well-known/openid-configuration /index.php/apps/openidconnect/config [R=301,L]
