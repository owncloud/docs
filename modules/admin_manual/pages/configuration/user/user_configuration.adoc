== Default View

The **default view** displays basic information about your users.

image:configuration/user/users-page.png[image]

The **Group filter** on the left sidebar lets you quickly filter users by
their group memberships, and create new groups.

Click the btn:[gear] icon on the lower left sidebar to view the avaiable settings.

**User accounts** have the following **properties**:

_Login Name (Username)_::
  The unique ID of an ownCloud user, and it cannot be changed.
_Full Name_::
  The user’s display name that appears on file shares, the ownCloud Web
  interface, and emails. Admins and users may change the Full Name
  anytime. If the Full Name is not set it defaults to the login name.
_Password_::
  The admin sets the new user’s first password. Both the user and the
  admin can change the user’s password at anytime.
_E-Mail_::
  The admin sets the new user’s E-Mail. The user then get's an E-Mail to set his Password.
  Both the user and the admin can change the user’s E-Mail at anytime.
_Groups_::
  You may create groups, and assign group memberships to users. By
  default new users are not assigned to any groups.
_Group Admin_::
  Group admins are granted administrative privileges on specific groups,
  and can add and remove users from their groups.
_Quota_::
  The maximum disk space assigned to each user. Any user that exceeds
  the quota cannot upload or sync data. You have the option to include
  external storage in user quotas.

== Creating a New User

To create a user account:

* Enter the new user’s *Login Name* and their *E-Mail*
* Optionally, assign *Groups* memberships
* Click the btn:[Create] button

image:configuration/user/users-page-new-user.png[image]

Login names may contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), dashes (-),
underscores (_), periods (.) and at signs (@). After creating the user,
you may fill in their *Full Name* if it is different than the login
name, or leave it for the user to complete.

== Password Reset

You cannot recover a user’s password, but you can set a new one:

* Hover your cursor over the user’s *Password* field
* Click on the btn:[pencil] icon
* Enter the user’s new password in the password field, and remember to
provide the user with their password

If you have encryption enabled, there are special considerations for user password resets.

TIP: See xref:configuration/files/encryption/encryption_configuration.adoc[Encryption Configuration].

=== Renaming a User

Each ownCloud user has two names: a unique *Login Name* used for
authentication, and a *Full Name*, which is their display name. You can
edit the display name of a user, but you cannot change the login name of
any user.

To set or change a user’s display name:

* Hover your cursor over the user’s *Full Name* field
* Click on the btn:[pencil] icon
* Enter the user’s new display name

== Deleting Users

image:configuration/user/delete-user-confirmation.png[The ownCloud delete user confirmation dialog.]

To delete a user, hover your cursor over their name on the *Users* page, and click the trashcan icon that appears at the far right. 
You’ll then see a confirmation dialog appear, asking if you’re sure that you want to delete the user. 

If you click btn:[Yes], the user is permanently deleted, including all of the files owned by the user, including all files they have shared. 
If you need to preserve the user’s files and shares, you must first download them from your ownCloud Files page, (which compresses them into a zip file). 

Alternatively, you can use a sync client to copy them to your local computer.
If you click btn:[No], the confirmation dialog will disappear and the user is not deleted.

TIP: See xref:{file-sharing-configuration-url}[File Sharing Configuration] to learn how to create persistent file shares that survive user deletions.

== Granting Administrator Privileges

ownCloud has two types of administrators: 

* *ownCloud Administrators* have full rights on your ownCloud server, and can
access and modify all settings. To assign the ownCloud Administrators
role to a user, simply add them to the `admin` group.

* *Group Administrators*. Group administrators have the rights to create,
edit and delete users in their assigned groups. Use the dropdown menus in the Group Admin column to assign group admin privileges.

== Managing Groups

You can assign new users to groups when you create them, and create new
groups when you create new users. You may also use the *Add Group*
button at the top of the left pane to create new groups. New group
members will immediately have access to file shares that belong to their
new groups.

== Enabling Custom Groups

In previous versions of ownCloud, files and folders could only be shared
with individual users or groups created by administrators. This wasn’t
the most efficient way to work. From ownCloud 10.0, users can create
groups on-the-fly, through a feature called "Custom Groups", enabling
them to share content in a more flexible way.

To enable Custom Groups:

1.  From the ownCloud Market, which you can find in version 10.0 under 
the Apps menu, click btn:[Market].
2.  Click btn:[Collaboration] (1), to filter the list of available
options and click the btn:[Custom groups] application (2).

3.  Click btn:[INSTALL] in the bottom right-hand corner of the Custom Groups application.

With this done, Custom Group functionality will be available in your ownCloud installation.


== Setting Storage Quotas

There are 4 types of quota settings in ownCloud when dealing with LDAP users.

=== Quota Field

Found in menu:User Authentication[the Advanced Tab > Special Attributes],
this setting overwrites the rest. If set, this is what will be set for an LDAP user’s quota in ownCloud.

=== Quota Default

Found in menu:User Authentication[the Advanced Tab > Special Attributes], this is the fallback option
if no quota field is defined.

=== User Quota

This is what you set in the web UI drop down menu, and is how you set user quota.

=== Default Quota

This will be set if no quota is set, and is found in menu:Users Tab[Gear Wheel > Default Quota].
If *Quota Field* is not set, but *Quota Default* is, and a systems administrator tries to set
a quota for an LDAP user with *User Quota*, it will not work, since it is overridden by
*Quota Default*.

Click the btn:[gear] icon on the lower left pane to set a default storage quota.
This is automatically applied to new users. You may assign a different
quota to any user by selecting from the *Quota* dropdown, selecting
either a preset value or entering a custom value. When you create custom
quotas, use the normal abbreviations for your storage values such as 500
MB, 5 GB, 5 TB, and so on.

'''

=== External Storage Quota

You now have a configurable option in `config.php` that controls whether
external storage is counted against user’s quotas. This is still
experimental, and may not work as expected. The default is to not count
external storage as part of user storage quotas. If you prefer to
include it, then change the default `false` to `true`.:

----
'quota_include_external_storage' => false,
----

'''
=== Storage Space Considerations

Metadata (such as thumbnails, temporary files, and encryption keys)
takes up about 10% of disk space, but is not counted against user
quotas. Users can check their used and available space on their Personal
pages. Only files that originate with users count against their quotas,
and not files shared with them that originate from other users. For
example, if you upload files to a different user’s share, those files
count against your quota. If you re-share a file that another user
shared with you, that file does not count against your quota, but the
originating user’s.

Encrypted files are a little larger than unencrypted files; the
unencrypted size is calculated against the user’s quota.

Deleted files that are still in the trash bin do not count against
quotas. The trash bin is set at 50% of quota. Deleted file aging is set
at 30 days. When deleted files exceed 50% of quota then the oldest files
are removed until the total is below 50%.

'''
=== Versions

When version control is enabled, the older file versions are not counted
against quotas.

'''
=== Public Links

When a user creates a public link share via URL, and allows uploads, any
uploaded files count against that user’s quota.
