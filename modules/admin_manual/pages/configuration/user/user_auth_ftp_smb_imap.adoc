= User Authentication with IMAP, SMB, and FTP
:toc: right
:toclevels: 1

== Overview

You may configure additional user backends in ownCloud’s configuration
file (`config/config.php`) using the following syntax:

[source,php]
----
<?php

"user_backends" => [
    0 => [
        "class"     => ...,
        "arguments" => [
            0 => ...
        ],
    ],
],
----

NOTE: A non-blocking or correctly configured SELinux setup is needed for these backends to work, 
if SELinux is enabled on your server. 
Please refer to xref:installation/selinux_configuration.adoc[the SELinux configuration] for further details.

Currently the https://github.com/owncloud/apps[External user support app] (user_external),
_which is not enabled by default_, provides three backends. These are:

* xref:imap[IMAP]
* xref:smb[SMB]
* xref:ftp[FTP]

See xref:installation/apps_management_installation.adoc[Installing and Managing Apps] for more information.

== IMAP

Provides authentication against IMAP servers.

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
| Option | Value/Description
| Class | `OC_User_IMAP`.

| Arguments | A mailbox string as defined +
http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.imap-open.php[in the PHP documentation].
| Dependency | http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.imap.php[PHP’s IMAP extension]. +
See xref:installation/manual_installation.adoc[Manual Installation on Linux]
| | for instructions on how to install it.
|=======================================================================

=== Example

[source,php]
----
<?php

"user_backends" => [
    0 => [
        "class"     => "OC_User_IMAP",
        "arguments" => [
            // The IMAP server to authenticate against
            '{imap.gmail.com:993/imap/ssl}',
            // The domain to send email from
            'example.com'
        ],
    ],
],
----

IMPORTANT: The second `arguments` parameter ensures that only users from that domain are allowed to login. When set, after a successful login, the domain will be stripped from the email address and the rest used as an ownCloud username. For example, if the email address is `guest.user@example.com`, then `guest.user` will be the username used by ownCloud.

SMB
---

Provides authentication against Samba servers.

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
| Option | Value/Description
| Class | `OC_User_SMB`.

| Arguments | The samba server to authenticate against.

| Dependency | https://pecl.php.net/package/smbclient[PECL’s smbclient extension] or +
xref:configuration/files/external_storage/smb.adoc[smbclient].

=== Example

[source,php]
----
<?php

"user_backends" => [
    [
        "class"     => "OC_User_SMB",
