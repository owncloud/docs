= Language Configuration
:wiki-url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes

In normal cases, ownCloud will automatically detect the language of the
Web-GUI. If this does not work as expected, or you want to make sure that
ownCloud always starts with a given language, you can use the
*default_language* configuration parameter.

This parameter can be set in _config/config.php_

== Parameters

[source,php]
----
'default_language' => 'en',
----

Please keep in mind, that this will not effect a users language preference,
which can be configured under menu:Settings[Personal > General > Language] once he has logged in.

More supported languages can be found in directory _<ownCloud_root>/settings/l10n_. List all files with _ls *.js_.
The language code to be used is the filename without extension.

Example:
----
en_GB.js --> en_GB
----

Please see {wiki-url}[Wikipedia] for a match of language code to country.
