= Language Configuration
:wiki-url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes

In normal cases, ownCloud will automatically detect the language of the
Web UI. If this does not work as expected, or you want to make sure that
ownCloud always starts with a given language, you can use the
*default_language* configuration parameter.

This parameter can be set in _config/config.php_

== Parameters

[source,php]
----
'default_language' => 'en',
----

Keep in mind that this will not affect the language preferences of users,
which can be configured under menu:Settings[Personal > General > Language] once they have logged in.

More supported languages can be found in directory _<ownCloud_root>/settings/l10n_. List all files with _ls *.js_.
The language code to be used is the filename without extension.

Example:
----
en_GB.js --> en_GB
----

Refer to {wiki-url}[Wikipedia] for a match of language code to country.
