= Encryption

`occ` includes a complete set of commands for managing encryption. When using a HSM (Hardware Security Module, can also be emulated by software), additional occ encryption-related commands can be used.

[source,console]
----

----

When using a HSM (Hardware Security Module, additional occ encryption-related commands can be used, see the HSM occ documentation below. The occ commands can also be used when HSM is initiated via software emulation like SoftHSM2.

[source,console]
----
encryption
 encryption:hsmdaemon                Export or Import the Masterkey
 encryption:hsmdaemon:decrypt        Decrypt a String
 config:app:set encryption           Various encryption configuration commands for HSM
----

== Status

`occ encryption:status` shows whether you have active encryption and your default encryption module. 
To enable encryption you must first enable the Encryption app and then run `occ encryption:enable`:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} app:enable encryption
{occ-command-example-prefix} encryption:enable
{occ-command-example-prefix} encryption:status
 - enabled: true
 - defaultModule: OC_DEFAULT_MODULE
----

== Encrypt the Users Home Storage

Server-side encryption for local storage like the users home and remote storages like Google Drive can operate independently of each other. By doing so, you can encrypt a remote storage without also having to encrypt the users home storage on your ownCloud server. Possible values are `0` and `1`

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
config:app:set encryption encryptHomeStorage --value '1' 
----

== Change Key Storage Root

`encryption:change-key-storage-root` is for moving your encryption keys to a different folder within your data directory. 
It takes one argument, which defines your new root folder. 
The folder must exist and the path is relative to your data directory.

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} encryption:change-key-storage-root ../data/security/oc-keys
----

You can see the current location of your keys folder:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} encryption:show-key-storage-root
Current key storage root:  default storage location (data/)
----

== List Modules

`encryption:list-modules` displays your available encryption modules.
You will see a list of modules only if you have enabled the Encryption app. 
Use `encryption:set-default-module [module name]` to set your desired module.

== Encrypt All

`encryption:encrypt-all` encrypts all data files for all users.
You must first put your ownCloud server into xref:maintenance-commands[single-user mode] to prevent any user activity until encryption is completed.

=== Arguments

[width="100%",cols="20%,70%",]
|===
| `-y` or `--yes` 
| Answer yes to all questions. This argument automatically answers, potential, questions with "yes", which is particularly important for automated deployments with Ansible or similar tools.
|===

== Decrypt All

`encryption:decrypt-all` decrypts all user data files, or optionally a single user:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} encryption:decrypt freda
----

Users must have enabled recovery keys on their Personal pages. 
You must first put your ownCloud server into single-user mode, using xref:maintenance-commands[the maintenance commands], to prevent any user activity until decryption is completed.

=== Arguments

[width="100%",cols="20%,70%",]
|===
| `-m=[METHOD]` | Accepts the methods: +
`recovery` or `password` +
If the _recovery_ method is chosen, then the recovery password will be used to decrypt files. +
If the _password_ method is chosen, then individual user passwords will be used to decrypt files.
| `-c=[COMMAND]` | Accepts  the commands: +
`yes` or `no` +

This lets the command know whether to ask for permission to continue or not.
|===

== Fix Encrypted Version

`encryption:fix-encrypted-version` fixes the encrypted version of files if the encrypted file(s) are not downloadable for a given user. You only need this command if you get an "Invalid Signature" message in the browser or the clients.

Background: the `oc_filecache` database table contains the integer columns "version" and "encryptedVersion" which start with 1 and are incremented on every file modification. When using encryption, those values are used together with the ciphertext to generate a cryptographic signature for the file. The version value is required to verify the signature. In some very rare cases like timeouts or bugs etc, the value might not get updated accordingly or get lost. The brute-force approach is to use the `fix:encrypted:version` command until the file can be decrypted. Starting with ownCloud 10.8, the behavior of the command got improved so that the encryptedVersion value is reset to its original value if no correct version was found. Before that fix, the last tried value was stored in the database thus modifying the state of the system and making further rescue attempts non-deterministic.

=== Arguments

[width="100%",cols="20%,70%",]
|===
| `user` | The id of the user whose files need fixing.
|===

== Method Descriptions

=== Recovery method

This method reads the value from the environment variable `OC_RECOVERY_PASSWORD`. 
This variable bounds the value of recovery password set in the encryption page. 
If this variable is not set the recovery process will be halted. 
This has to be used for decrypting all users. 
While opting recovery method user should not forget to set `OC_RECOVERY_PASSWORD` in the shell.

=== Password method

This method reads the value from the environment variable `OC_PASSWORD`. 
This variable bounds the value of user password. 
The password which user uses to login to oC account. 
When password method is opted the user needs to set this variable in the shell.

== Continue Option Description

The continue option can be used to bypass the permissions asked like `yes` or `no` while decrypting the file system.
If the user is sure about what he/she is doing with the command and would like to proceed, then `-c yes` when provided to the command would not ask permissions. 
If `-c no` is passed to the command, then permissions would be asked to the user. It becomes interactive.

Use `encryption:disable` to disable your encryption module.
You must first put your ownCloud server into xref:maintenance-commands[single-user mode] to prevent any user activity.

`encryption:migrate` migrates encryption keys after a major ownCloud version upgrade.
You may optionally specify individual users in a space-delimited list.
See xref:configuration/files/encryption/encryption_configuration.adoc[encryption configuration] to learn more.

`encryption:recreate-master-key` decrypts the ownCloud file system, replaces the existing master key with a new one, and encrypts the entire ownCloud file system with the new master key. 
Given the size of your ownCloud filesystem, this may take some time to complete. 
However, if your filesystem is quite small, then it will complete quite quickly. 
The `-y` switch can be supplied to automate acceptance of user input.

== HSM Related Commands

=== Export or Import the Masterkey

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} encryption:hsmdaemon [options]
----

=== Options

[width="100%",cols="20%,70%",]
|===
| `--export-masterkey` | Export the private master key in base64
| `--import-masterkey= +
IMPORT-MASTERKEY`     | Import a base64 encoded private masterkey.
|===

`--export-masterkey` prints the base64_encode of the file `data/files_encryption/OC_DEFAULT_MODULE/master_*.privateKey`.

The private key file in the directory may be named like `master_08ea43b7.privateKey`.


=== Test to Decrypt a String

Allows to test the `hsmdaemon` setup by providing an encrypted string to ownCloud and test if it can be decrypted.

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} encryption:hsmdaemon:decrypt [options] [--] <decrypt>
----

=== Arguments

[width="100%",cols="20%,70%",]
|===
| `decrypt` | The string to decrypt
|===

=== Options

[width="100%",cols="20%,70%",]
|===
| `--username[=USERNAME]` | The name of the user who is able to decrypt the provided string
| `--keyId[=KEYID]`       | The keyId which was used to encrypt the provided string
|===

=== Set the HSM URL

Set the url on which the `hsmdaemon` REST-API is reachable.

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:app:set encryption hsm.url --value 'http://127.0.0.1:8513'
----

=== Set the JSON Web Token Secret

To access the `hsmdaemon` API, ownCloud must authenticate with a JWT (JSON Web Token). The given secret is shared between the `hsdmdaemon` (see the hsmdaemon.toml configuration file) and ownCloud to sign the JWT. See the xref:configuration/server/security/hsmdaemon/index.adoc[HSM documentation] for an example how to generate a secret.

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:app:set encryption hsm.jwt.secret --value '7a7d1826-b514-4d9f-afc7-a7485084e8de'
----

=== Set the JWT Clockskew

The JWT described above has an expiry timestamp. In case the time clocks on ownCloud and hsmdaemon system drift or skew apart, additional time is added to the expiry time to counteract this situation. Set or change the clockskew only if ownCloud advises to do so. Defaults to 120, value is in seconds.

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:app:set encryption hsm.jwt.clockskew --value '120' 
----
