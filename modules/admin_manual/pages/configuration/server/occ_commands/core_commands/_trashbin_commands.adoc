[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} trashbin:cleanup molly freda
Remove deleted files of   molly
Remove deleted files of   freda
----

`trashbin:expire` deletes only expired files according to the `trashbin_retention_obligation` setting in `config.php` (see xref:configuration/server/config_sample_php_parameters.adoc[the "Deleted Files" section documentation]).
The default is to delete expired files for all users, or you may list users in a space-delimited list.
