= Federation Sync

Synchronize the address books of all federated ownCloud servers.

Servers connected with federation shares can share user address books, and auto-complete usernames in share dialogs. 
Use this command to synchronize federated servers:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} federation:sync-addressbooks
----

NOTE: This command is only available when the "Federation" app (`federation`) is enabled.
