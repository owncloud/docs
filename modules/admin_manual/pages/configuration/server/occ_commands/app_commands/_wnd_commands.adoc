----
{occ-command-example-prefix} wnd:listen [options] [--] <host> <share> <username> [<password>]
----

=== Arguments

[width="90%",cols="40%,80%",]
|===
| `host` 
| The hostname or IP address of the server to listen to
| `share`
| The share inside the host to listen to for changes
| `username` 
| The username that will be used to connect to the share
| `password`
| The user's password (will be asked for if it isn't provided)
|===

=== Options

[width="90%",cols="40%,80%",]
|===
| `-p, +
--path=PATH` 
| The path inside the share to watch for changes [default: ""]

| `--password-file=PASSWORD-FILE`
| The file containing the password for the account to be used to listen

| `--password-from-service-account`
| Use the password from the matching service account. This works only for collaborative WND mounts

| `--password-trim` 
| Trim blank characters from the password

| `--unbuffering-option=UNBUFFERING-OPTION`
| Force the usage of that unbuffering option for the underlying smbclient command. Possible options are either "auto", "pty" or "stdbuf" [default: "auto"]

| `--output[=OUTPUT]`
| The output format to use (plain, json or json_pretty). [default: "plain"] 
|===

[NOTE]
====
. To enter the password of the service account via the console, the `password` option, the `password-file` option and the `password-from-service-account` option must not be set.

. To use the password for the service account from the mount point settings, use the `password-from-service-account` option.

. If you use the `password` option together with the `password-file` option, the `password-file` option takes precedence over the `password` argument.
