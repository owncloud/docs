== Introduction

When you report a problem to {owncloud-support-url}[ownCloud Support] or our {owncloud-central-url}[Forum (ownCloud Central)] you will be asked to provide certain log files or configurations for our engineers (or other users). 
These are essential in better understanding your issue, your specific configuration, and the cause of the problem.

Here are instructions for how to collect them.

== Generate a Config Report

You can use the webUI or the command line to generate a config report.
Please note that you have to have the configreport app enabled. 
Check if it's already enabled by going to the apps section of the admin settings.
You can enable this app using the following commands:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
# Install it, if it’s not already installed
{occ-command-example-prefix} market:install configreport

# Or enable it, if it’s already installed
{occ-command-example-prefix}:app enable configreport
----

=== Generate via webUI

To generate a config report using the webUI, navigate to: +
menu:Settings[Admin > General > "Generate Config report" > "Download ownCloud config report"].

=== Generate via Command Line

To generate a config report from the command line, run the following command from the root directory of your ownCloud installation:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} configreport:generate > config_report.txt
----

== ownCloud Server Log File

=== Generate via webUI

You can use the webUI to download your ownCloud Server log file. To do so, navigate to: + 
menu:Settings[Admin > General > Log > "Download logfile"].

=== Generate via Command Line

If the log file is too big, you will need to transfer it from the command line. 
The location of the log file can be found in your config.php. It's in your data directory. 

....
 'datadirectory' => '/var/www/owncloud/data',
....

You also can specify a different location of the log file.

....
'logfile' => '/home/www-data/owncloud.log',
....

Note that the web server user has to have rights to write in that directory.

== LDAP Config

Assuming that LDAP is used, viewing the LDAP configuration is important when checking for errors between your ownCloud instance and your LDAP server.
To get the output file, execute this command:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} ldap:show-config > ldap_config.txt
----
