= Apps Config.php Parameters
:toc: right
:toclevels: 1

== Introduction

This document describes parameters for apps maintained by ownCloud that are not part of the core system.
All keys are only valid if the corresponding app is installed and enabled. 
You must copy the keys needed to the active `config.php` file.

== Multiple configuration files

ownCloud supports loading configuration parameters from multiple files.
You can add arbitrary files ending with .config.php in the config/ directory.

=== Example:

You could place your email server configuration in `email.config.php`.
This allows you to easily create and manage custom configurations or to divide a large complex configuration file into a set of smaller files.
These custom files are not overwritten by ownCloud, and the values in these files take precedence over `config.php`.

ownCloud may write configurations into `config.php`. 
These configurations may conflict with identical keys already set in additional config files. Be careful when using this capability!

== App: Metrics

Note: This app is for Enterprise customers only.

Possible keys: `metrics_shared_secret` STRING

=== Secret to use the Metrics dashboard
You have to set a Metrics secret to use the dashboard. You cannot use the dashboard
without defining a secret. You can use any secret you like. In case you want to generate
a random secret, use the following example command:
`echo $(tr -dc 'a-z0-9' < /dev/urandom | head -c 20)`
It is also possible to set this secret via an occ command which writes key and data to the
config.php file. Please see the occ command documentation for more information.

==== Code Sample

....
'metrics_shared_secret' => 'replace-with-your-own-random-string',
....

== App: Microsoft Office Online (WOPI)

Note: This app is for Enterprise customers only.

Possible keys: `wopi.token.key` STRING

Possible keys: `wopi.office-online.server` URL

Possible keys: `wopi_group` STRING

=== Random key created by the ownCloud admin
This is a random key created by the ownCloud admin. This key is used by ownCloud
to create encrypted JWT tokens for the communication with your Microsoft Office Online instance.

You can use the following example command to generate a random key:
`echo $(tr -dc 'a-z0-9' < /dev/urandom | head -c 20)`

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'wopi.token.key' => 'replace-with-your-own-random-string',
....

=== Microsoft Office Online instance URL
This is the URL of the Microsoft Office Online instance ownCloud communicates with. Keep
in mind that you need to grant communication access at your Microsoft Office
Online instance with this ownCloud instance. For further information, read the
ownCloud documentation.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'wopi.office-online.server' => 'https://your.office.online.server.tld',
....

=== Define the group name for users allowed to use Microsoft Office Online
Restrict access to Microsoft Office Online to a defined group. Please note, only one group can be defined. Default = empty = no restriction.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'wopi_group' => '',
....

== App: Microsoft Teams Bridge

Possible keys: `msteamsbridge` ARRAY

Sub key: `loginButtonName` STRING

=== Login Button Label
This key is necessary for security reasons. Users will be asked to click a login
button each time when accessing the ownCloud app after a fresh start of their
Microsoft Teams app or after idle time. This behavior is by design. The button
name can be freely set based on your requirements.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'msteamsbridge' => [
   "loginButtonName" => "Login to ownCloud with Azure AD",
],
....

== App: OpenID Connect (OIDC)

Possible keys: `openid-connect` ARRAY


**Configure OpenID Connect - all possible sub-keys**

_You have to use the main key together with sub keys listed below, see code samples._

allowed-user-backends::
Limit the users which are allowed to login to a specific user backend - e.g. LDAP
(`'allowed-user-backends' â‡’ ['LDAP']`)

auth-params::
Additional parameters which are sent to the IdP during the auth requests

autoRedirectOnLoginPage::
If `true`, the ownCloud login page will redirect directly to the Identity Provider
login without requiring the user to click a button. The default is `false`.

auto-provision::
If auto-provision is setup, an ownCloud user will be created if not exists, after successful
login using openid connect. The config parameters `mode` and `search-attribute` will be used
to create a unique user so that the lookup mechanism can find the user again. This is where
an LDAP setup is usually required.
If auto-provision is not setup or required, it is expected that the user exists and you
MUST declare this with `['enabled' => false]` like shown in the Easy Setup example.
`auto-provision` holds several sub keys, see the example setup with the explanations below.

insecure::
Boolean value (`true`/`false`), no SSL verification will take place when talking to the
IdP - **DO NOT use in production!**

loginButtonName::
The name as displayed on the login screen which is used to redirect to the IdP.
By default, the OpenID Connect App will add a button on the login page that will
redirect the user to the Identity Provider and allow authentication via OIDC.
This parameter allows the button text to be modified.

mode::
This is the attribute in the owncloud accounts table to search for users.
The default value is `email`. The alternative value is: `userid`.

post_logout_redirect_uri::
A given URL where the IdP should redirect to after logout.

provider-params::
Additional config array depending on the IdP to be entered here - usually only necessary if
the IdP does not support service discovery.

provider-url, client-id and client-secret::
Variables are to be taken from the OpenID Connect Provider's setup.
For the `provider-url`, the URL where the IdP is living.
In some cases (KeyCloak, Azure AD) this holds more than just a domain but also a path.

redirect-url::
The full URL under which the ownCloud OpenId Connect redirect URL is reachable - only
needed in special setups.

scopes::
Enter the list of required scopes depending on the IdP setup.

search-attribute::
The attribute which is taken from the access token JWT or user info endpoint to identify
the user. This is the claim from the OpenID Connect user information which shall be
used for searching in the accounts table. The default value is `email`. For
more information about the claim, see
https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Claims.

token-introspection-endpoint-client-id::
Client ID to be used with the token introspection endpoint.

token-introspection-endpoint-client-secret::
Client secret to be used with the token introspection endpoint.

use-access-token-payload-for-user-info::
If set to `true` any user information will be read from the access token.
If set to `false` the userinfo endpoint is used (starting app version 1.1.0).

use-token-introspection-endpoint::
If set to `true`, the token introspection endpoint is used to verify a given access
token - only needed if the access token is not a JWT. If set to `false`, the userinfo
endpoint is used (requires version >= 1.1.0)
Tokens which are not JSON WebToken (JWT) may not have information like the
expiry. In these cases, the OpenID Connect Provider needs to call on the token
introspection endpoint to get this information. The default value is `false`. See
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7662 for more information on token introspection.

=== Easy setup

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'openid-connect' => [
	  // it is expected that the user already exists in ownCloud
	'auto-provision' => ['enabled' => false],
	'provider-url' => 'https://idp.example.net',
	'client-id' => 'fc9b5c78-ec73-47bf-befc-59d4fe780f6f',
	'client-secret' => 'e3e5b04a-3c3c-4f4d-b16c-2a6e9fdd3cd1',
	'loginButtonName' => 'OpenId Connect'
],
....

=== Setup auto provisioning mode

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'openid-connect' => [
	  // explicit enable the auto provisioning mode,
	  // if not exists, the user will be created in ownCloud
	'auto-provision' => [
		'enabled' => true,
		  // documentation about standard claims:
		  // https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims
		  // only relevant in userid mode, defines the claim which holds the email of the user
		'email-claim' => 'email',
		  // defines the claim which holds the display name of the user
		'display-name-claim' => 'given_name',
		  // defines the claim which holds the picture of the user - must be a URL
		'picture-claim' => 'picture',
		  // defines a list of groups to which the newly created user will be added automatically
		'groups' => ['admin', 'guests', 'employees']
	],
	  // `mode` and `search-attribute` will be used to create a unique user in ownCloud
	'mode' => 'email',
	'search-attribute' => 'email',
],
....

=== Manual setup

==== Code Sample

[source,php]

....
'openid-connect' => [
	  // it is expected that the user already exists in ownCloud
	'auto-provision' => ['enabled' => false],
	'provider-url' => 'http://localhost:3000',

],
....

== App: Richdocuments

Possible keys: `collabora_group` STRING

=== Define the group name for users allowed to use Collabora
Please note, only one group can be defined. Default = empty = no restriction.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'collabora_group' => '',
....

== App: Windows Network Drive (WND)

Note: This app is for Enterprise customers only.

Possible keys: `wnd.listen.reconnectAfterTime` INTEGER

Possible keys: `wnd.logging.enable` BOOL

Possible keys: `wnd.fileInfo.parseAttrs.mode` STRING

Possible keys: `wnd.in_memory_notifier.enable` BOOL

Possible keys: `wnd.permissionmanager.cache.size` INTEGER

Possible keys: `wnd2.cachewrapper.ttl` INTEGER

Possible keys: `wnd.activity.registerExtension` BOOL

Possible keys: `wnd.activity.sendToSharees` BOOL

Possible keys: `wnd.groupmembership.checkUserFirst` BOOL

*Note* With WND 2.1.0, key `wnd.storage.testForHiddenMount` is obsolete and has been removed completely.

=== Mandatory Listener Reconnect to the Database
The listener will reconnect to the DB after given seconds. This will
prevent the listener to crash if the connection to the DB is closed after
being idle for a long time.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'wnd.listen.reconnectAfterTime' => 28800,
....

=== Enable Additional Debug Logging for the WND App

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'wnd.logging.enable' => false,
....

=== The Way File Attributes for Folders and Files will be Handled
There are 3 possible values: "none", "stat" and "getxattr":

- "stat". This is the default if the option is missing or has an invalid value.
  This means that the file attributes will be evaluated only for files, NOT for folders.
  Folders will be shown even if the "hidden" file attribute is set.

- "none". This means that the file attributes won't be evaluated in any case. Both
  hidden files and folders will be shown, and you can write on read-only files
  (the action is available in ownCloud, but it will fail in the SMB server).

- "getxattr". This means that file attributes will always be evaluated. However, due to
  problems in recent libsmbclient versions (4.11+, it might be earlier) it will cause
  malfunctions in ownCloud; permissions are wrongly evaluated. So far, this mode works
  with libsmbclient 4.7 but not with 4.11+ (not tested with any version in between).

Note that the ACLs (if active) will be evaluated and applied on top of this mechanism.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'wnd.fileInfo.parseAttrs.mode' => stat,
....

=== Enable or Disable the WND In-Memory Notifier for Password Changes
Having this feature enabled implies that whenever a WND process detects a
wrong password in the storage - maybe the password has changed in the
backend - all WND storages that are in-memory will be notified in order to reset
their passwords if applicable and not to requery again.

The intention is to prevent a potential password lockout for the user in the backend.
As with PHP lower than 7.4, this feature can take a lot of memory resources.
This is because WND keeps the storage access and its caches in-memory.
With PHP 7.4 or above, the memory usage has been reduced a significantly.
Alternatively, you can disable this feature completely.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'wnd.in_memory_notifier.enable' => true,
....

=== Maximum Number of Items for the Cache Used by the WND Permission Managers
A higher number implies that more items are allowed, increasing the memory usage.

Real memory usage per item varies because it depends on the path being cached.
Note that this is an in-memory cache used per request.
Multiple mounts using the same permission manager will share the same
cache, limiting the maximum memory that will be used.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'wnd.permissionmanager.cache.size' => 512,
....

=== TTL for the WND2 Caching Wrapper
Time to Live (TTL) in seconds to be used to cache information for the WND2 (collaborative)
cache wrapper implementation. The value will be used by all WND2 storages. Although the
cache isn't exactly per user but per storage id, consider the cache to be per user, because
it will be like that for common use cases. Data will remain in the cache and won't
be removed by ownCloud. Aim for a low TTL value in order to not fill the memcache
completely. In order to properly disable caching, use -1 or any negative value. 0 (zero)
isn't considered a valid TTL value and will also disable caching.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'wnd2.cachewrapper.ttl' => 1800,  // 30 minutes
....

=== Enable to Push WND Events to the Activity App
Register WND as extension into the Activity app in order to send information about what
the `wnd:process-queue` command is doing. The activity sent will be based on what
the `wnd:process-queue` detects, and the activity will be sent to each affected user. There
won't be any activity being sent outside of the `wnd:process-queue` command. `wnd:listen` +
`wnd:process-queue` + `activity app` are required for this to work properly. See `wnd.activity.sendToSharees`
below for information on how to send activities for shared resources. Please consider
that this can have a performance impact when changes are sent to many users.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'wnd.activity.registerExtension' => false,
....

=== Enable to Send WND Activity Notifications to Sharees
The `wnd:process-queue` command will also send activity notifications to the sharees
if a WND file or folder is shared (or accessible via a share). It's REQUIRED that the
`wnd.activity.registerExtension` flag is set to true (see above), otherwise this flag will
be ignored. This flag depends on the `wnd.activity.registerExtension` and has the same restrictions.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'wnd.activity.sendToSharees' => false,
....

=== Make the Group Membership Component Assume that the ACL Contains a User
The WND app doesn't know about the users or groups associated with ACLs. This
means that an ACL containing "admin" might refer to a user called "admin" or a
group called "admin". By default, the group membership component considers the ACLs to
target groups, and as such, it will try to get the information for such a group. This
works fine if the majority of the ACLs target groups. If the majority of the ACLs
contain users, this might be problematic. The cost of getting information on a
group is usually higher than getting information on a user. This option
makes the group membership component assume the ACL contains a user and checks whether
there is a user in ownCloud with such a name first. If the name doesn't refer to a user,
it will get the group information. Note that this will have performance implications
if the group membership component can't discard users in a large number of cases. It is
recommended to enable this option only if there are a high number of ACLs targeting users.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'wnd.groupmembership.checkUserFirst' => false,
....

== App: Workflow / Tagging

Note: This app is for Enterprise customers only.

Possible keys: `workflow.retention_engine` STRING

=== Provide Advanced Management of File Tagging
Enables admins to specify rules and conditions (file size, file mimetype, group membership and more)
to automatically assign tags to uploaded files. Values: `tagbased` (default) or `userbased`.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'workflow.retention_engine' => 'tagbased',
....
