== What is it?

OAuth2 is summarized in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.1[RFC 6749] as follows:

  The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.

Here is an overview of how the process works:

== The OAuth2 App

OAuth2 support is available in ownCloud via https://marketplace.owncloud.com/apps/oauth2[an OAuth2 application] which is available from the ownCloud Marketplace.
The app aims to:

. Connect ownCloud clients (both desktop and mobile) in a standardized and secure way.
. Make 3rd party software integrations easier by providing an unified authorization interface.

=== Endpoints

[cols=",",options="header",]
|==========================
| Description | URI
| Authorization URL | `/index.php/apps/oauth2/authorize`
| Access Token URL  | `/index.php/apps/oauth2/api/v1/token`
|==========================

=== Protocol Flow

==== Client Registration

The clients first have to be registered in the admin settings: `/settings/admin?sectionid=authentication`.
You need to specify a name for the client (the name is unrelated to the OAuth 2.0 protocol and is just used to recognize it later) and the redirection URI.
A client identifier and client secret are generated when adding a new client, which both consist of 64 characters.
For further information about client registration, please refer to https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2[the official client registration RFC from the IETF].

==== Authorization Request

For every registered client an authorization request can be made.
The client redirects the resource owner to the authorization URL and requests authorization.
The following URL parameters have to be specified:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|==========================
| Parameter
| Required
| Description

| `response_type`
| yes
| Needs to be `code` because at this time only the authorization code flow is implemented.

| `client_id`
| yes
| The client identifier obtained when registering the client.

| `redirect_uri`
| yes
| The redirection URI specified when registering the client.

| `state`
| no
| Can be set by the client "to maintain state between the request and callback". See `RFC 6749`_ for more information.
|==========================

For further information about client registration, please refer to https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.1[the official authorization request RFC from the IETF].

==== Authorization Response

After the resource owner's authorization, the app redirects to the `redirect_uri` specified in the authorization request and adds the authorization code as URL parameter `code`.
An authorization code is valid for 10 minutes.
For further information about client registration, please refer to https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.2[the official authorization response RFC from the IETF].

==== Access Token Request

With the authorization code, the client can request an access token using the access token URL.
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.3[Client authentication] is done using basic authentication with the client identifier as username and the client secret as a password.
The following URL parameters have to be specified:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|==========================
| Parameter
| Required
| Description

| `grant_type`
|
| Either `authorization_code` or `refresh_token`.

| `code`
| if the grant type `authorization_code` is used.
|

| `redirect_uri`
| if the grant type `authorization_code` is used.
|

| `refresh_token`
| if the grant type `refresh_token` is used.
|
|==========================

For further information about client registration, please refer to https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.3[the official access token request RFC from the IETF].

==== Access Token Response

The app responses to a valid access token request with a JSON response like the following.
An access token is valid for 1 hour and can be refreshed with a refresh token.

== Installation

To install the application, place the content of the OAuth2 app inside your installation's `app` directory, or use the Market application.

== Requirements

If you are hosting your ownCloud installation from the Apache web server, then both the 
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html[mod_rewrite] and
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_headers.html[mod_headers] modules
are required to be installed and enabled.

== Basic Configuration

To enable token-only based app or client logins in `config/config.php` set `token_auth_enforced` to `true`.

== Restricting Usage

- Enterprise installations can limit the access of authorized clients, preventing unwanted clients from connecting.

== Limitations

- Since the app does not handle user passwords, only master key encryption works (similar to {shibboleth-app-url}[the Shibboleth app]).
- Clients cannot migrate accounts from Basic Authorization to OAuth2, if they are currently using the `user_ldap` backend.
- It is not possible to explicitly end user sessions when using OAuth2. Have a read through {oauth2-user-auth-url}[User Authentication with OAuth 2.0] to find out more.
