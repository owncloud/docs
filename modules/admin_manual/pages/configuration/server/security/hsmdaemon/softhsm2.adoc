SoftHSM2 is a simple approach for employing storage encryption with a master key in an HSM, because it store the keys in place of ownCloud.

== Use SoftHSM2 With hsmdaemon

SoftHSM2 can be used with and xref:configuration/server/security/hsmdaemon/index.adoc[hsmdaemon] to store keys in place of ownCloud; either on the same or a different machine as ownCloud.
Because keys are stored with a different owner to ownCloud, it prevents the web server (xref:installation/system_requirements.adoc#officially-recommended-supported-options[typically Apache]) from directly reading the key material.
This helps prevent a malicious actor from reading files, if they can impersonate the web server user.
However, it doesn't help if the malicious actor can manipulate PHP files and run arbitrary code.

IMPORTANT: If you run SoftHSM2 and hsmdaemon on a different machine on the network, know that the hsmdaemon traffic is not encrypted.
In this scenario, the systems administrator would need to setup a secure tunnel to encrypt the traffic.

== Install SoftHSM2

If you do not have an HSM-provided PKCS11 library, then you can use {softhsm2-url}[SoftHSM2] instead.
To do so, follow the instructions for you Linux distribution below.

* xref:install-softhsm2-debian-ubuntu[Debian and Ubuntu]
* xref:install-softhsm2-opensuse-suse-linux-enterprise-server[openSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server]
* xref:install-softhsm2-fedora-red-hat-enterprise-linux-centos[Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Centos]

NOTE: Installing these two packages also installs `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/softhsm/libsofthsm2.so`, which is a module that we will need later, for interaction with the PKCS11 API.

=== Install on Debian and Ubuntu

To install SoftHSM2 on either Debian or Ubuntu, run the command below.

[source,console]
----
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y softhsm2 libsofthsm2
----

=== Install on openSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server

To install SoftHSM2, you first have to ensure that you have {opensuse-security-repositories-url}[the official security repository] for your server enabled in your server's repositories list. 
To check if it is, run the command `zypper lr`, which will show you output similar to the following:

[source,console]

11 | repo-update-non-oss       | openSUSE-Leap-15.0-Update-Non-Oss       | Yes     | (r ) Yes  | Yes 
----

TIP: use the `-d` flag to show the URI for each repository as well.

If there is no security repository available, then add it using the following command:

[source,console]
----
# Replace <security-repository> with the URL for your distribution and architecture.
sudo zypper addrepo \
  --check \
  --refresh \
  --name "openSUSE-Leap-15.0-Security" \
  <security-repository> \
  "repo-security"
----

With the repository enabled, install SoftHSM2 by running the following command:

[source,console]
----
sudo zypper install -y --auto-agree-with-licenses softhsm
----

=== Install on Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Centos 

To install SoftHSM2 on Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Centos, run the command below.

[source,console]
----
sudo yum install --assumeyes softhsm
----

=== Check the Configuration File

Once SoftHSM2 is installed, check that the directory specified by `directories.tokendir` in SoftHSM2's configuration file exists.

[options="headers",cols="3"]
|===
|Distribution |Configuration File Location |Tokens Directory
|Debian and Ubuntu |`/etc/softhsm/softhsm2.conf` .3+|`/var/lib/softhsm/tokens/`
|openSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server |`/etc/softhsm2.conf`
|Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Centos |`/etc/softhsm2.conf`
|===

[source,ini]
----
# SoftHSM v2 configuration file

directories.tokendir = /var/lib/softhsm/tokens/
objectstore.backend = file

# ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG
log.level = INFO
