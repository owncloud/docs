From the 2.0.0 release of https://marketplace.owncloud.com/apps/password_policy[the Password Policy app],
ownCloud administrators (both enterprise **and** community edition) have the option of installing and enabling 
the application. The Password Policy application enables administrators to define password requirements 
for user passwords and public links.

Some of policy rules apply to both user passwords and public links, and some apply to just one or the other.
The table below shows where each option can be used.

Here is an example of what an administrator will see:

image:configuration/server/password-policy/password-policy-configuration-web-ui.png[The ownCloud Password Policy app.]

NOTE: Active user sessions will **not** end when passwords expire.
However, a password change will be forced when the user session expires (e.g., on logout).
OAuth2 tokens for app or client authentication, and App passwords are not affected.

NOTE: Installing and enabling the application also extends the occ command to support
xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#password-policy[password policy] management.

CAUTION: After enabling the "*days until user password expires*" policy setting in the web UI,
administrators need to run the `occ user:expire-password` command to set an initial password
change date for all existing users.
