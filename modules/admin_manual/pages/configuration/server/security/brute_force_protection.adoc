= Brute-Force Protection

The Brute-Force Protection extension allows administrators to specify a maximum number of unsuccessful user account login attempts. On reaching the unsuccessful login limit, ownCloud temporarily bans further login attempts to those user accounts from the originating IP address. The time frame of the ban is configurable by ownCloud administrators.

To configure this app in the web interface, navigate to `admin -> settings -> admin/security`.
