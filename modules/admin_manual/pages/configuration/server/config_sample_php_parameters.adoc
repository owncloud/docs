= Config.php Parameters

ownCloud uses the `config/config.php` file to control server operations.
`config/config.sample.php` lists all the configurable parameters within
ownCloud, along with example or default values. This document provides a
more detailed reference. Most options are configurable on your Admin
page, so it is usually not necessary to edit `config/config.php`.

NOTE: The installer creates a configuration containing the essential parameters. +
Only manually add configuration parameters to `config/config.php` if you need to use a special
value for a parameter. *Do not copy everything from* `config/config.sample.php` *.
Only enter the parameters you wish to modify!*

ownCloud supports loading configuration parameters from multiple files.
You can add arbitrary files ending with .config.php in the config/
directory, for example you could place your email server configuration
in email.config.php. This allows you to easily create and manage custom
configurations, or to divide a large complex configuration file into a
set of smaller files. These custom files are not overwritten by
ownCloud, and the values in these files take precedence over config.php.

// header end do not delete or edit this line

== Default Parameters

These parameters are configured by the ownCloud installer, and are required
for your ownCloud server to operate.

=== This is a unique identifier for your ownCloud installation, created
automatically by the installer. This example is for documentation only,
and you should never use it because it will not work. A valid `instanceid`
is created when you install ownCloud. Needs to start with a letter.

'instanceid' => 'd3c944a9a',

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'instanceid' => '',
....

=== The salt used to hash all passwords, auto-generated by the ownCloud
installer. (There are also per-user salts.) If you lose this salt you lose
all your passwords. This example is for documentation only, and you should
never use it.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'passwordsalt' => '',
....

=== Your list of trusted domains that users can log into. Specifying trusted
domains prevents host header poisoning. Do not remove this, as it performs
necessary security checks. Please consider that for backend processes like
background jobs or occ commands, the url parameter in key `overwrite.cli.url`
is used. For more details please see that key.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'trusted_domains' =>
  array (
'demo.example.org',
'otherdomain.example.org',
  ),
....

=== The global list of CORS domains. All users can use tools running CORS
requests from the listed domains.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'cors.allowed-domains' => [
	'https://foo.example.org',
],
....

=== Where user files are stored; this defaults to `data/` in the ownCloud
directory. The SQLite database is also stored here, when you use SQLite.

(SQLite is not available in ownCloud Enterprise Edition)

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'datadirectory' => '/var/www/owncloud/data',
....

=== The current version number of your ownCloud installation. This is set up
during installation and update, so you shouldn't need to change it.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'version' => '',
....

=== While hardening an ownCloud instance hiding the version information in status.php
can be a legitimate step. Please consult the documentation before enabling this.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'version.hide' => false,
....

=== Optionally, show the hostname of the server in status.php. Defaults to hidden

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'show_server_hostname' => false,
....

=== Identifies the database used with this installation. See also config option
`supportedDatabases`

Available:
- sqlite (SQLite3 - Not in Enterprise Edition)
- mysql (MySQL/MariaDB)
- pgsql (PostgreSQL)
- oci (Oracle - Enterprise Edition Only)

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'dbtype' => 'sqlite',
....

=== Your host server name, for example `localhost`, `hostname`,
`hostname.example.com`, or the IP address. To specify a port use
`hostname:####`; to specify a Unix socket use
`localhost:/path/to/socket`.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'dbhost' => '',
....

=== The name of the ownCloud database, which is set during installation. You
should not need to change this.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'dbname' => 'owncloud',
....

=== The user that ownCloud uses to write to the database. This must be unique
across ownCloud instances using the same SQL database. This is set up during
installation, so you shouldn't need to change it.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'dbuser' => '',
....

=== The password for the database user. This is set up during installation, so
you shouldn't need to change it.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'dbpassword' => '',
....

=== Prefix for the ownCloud tables in the database.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'dbtableprefix' => '',
....

=== Indicates whether the ownCloud instance was installed successfully; `true`
indicates a successful installation, and `false` indicates an unsuccessful
installation.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'installed' => false,
....

== User Experience

These optional parameters control some aspects of the user interface. Default
values, where present, are shown.

=== This sets the default language on your ownCloud server, using ISO_639-1
language codes such as `en` for English, `de` for German, and `fr` for
French. It overrides automatic language detection on public pages like login
or shared items. User's language preferences configured under "personal ->
language" override this setting after they have logged in.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'default_language' => 'en_GB',
....

=== Set the default app to open on login. Use the app names as they appear in the
URL after clicking them in the Apps menu, such as documents, calendar, and
gallery. You can use a comma-separated list of app names, so if the first
app is not enabled for a user then ownCloud will try the second one, and so
on. If no enabled apps are found it defaults to the Files app.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'defaultapp' => 'files',
....

=== `true` enables the Help menu item in the user menu (top right of the
ownCloud Web interface). `false` removes the help item.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'knowledgebaseenabled' => true,
....

=== `true` enables avatars, or user profile photos. These appear on the User
page, on user's Personal pages and are used by some apps (contacts, mail,
etc). `false` disables them.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'enable_avatars' => true,
....

=== `true` allows users to change their display names (on their Personal
pages), and `false` prevents them from changing their display names.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'allow_user_to_change_display_name' => true,
....

=== Lifetime of the remember login cookie, which is set when the user clicks the
`remember` checkbox on the login screen. The default is 15 days, expressed
in seconds.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'remember_login_cookie_lifetime' => 60*60*24*15,
....

=== The lifetime of a session after inactivity; the default is 24 hours,
expressed in seconds.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'session_lifetime' => 60 * 60 * 24,
....

=== Enable or disable session keep-alive when a user is logged in to the Web UI.

Enabling this sends a "heartbeat" to the server to keep it from timing out.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'session_keepalive' => true,
....

=== Enforces token only authentication for apps and clients connecting to ownCloud.

If enabled, all access requests using the users password are blocked for enhanced security.
Users have to generate special app-passwords (tokens) for their apps or clients in their personal
settings which are further used for app or client authentication. Browser logon is not affected.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'token_auth_enforced' => false,
....

=== Allows to specify additional login buttons on the logon screen for e.g. SSO integration
 'login.alternatives' => [
   ['href' => 'https://www.testshib.org/Shibboleth.sso/ProtectNetwork?target=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.owncloud.tld%2Flogin%2Fsso-saml%2F', 'name' => 'ProtectNetwork', 'img' => '/img/PN_sign-in.gif'],
   ['href' => 'https://www.testshib.org/Shibboleth.sso/OpenIdP.org?target=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.owncloud.tld%2Flogin%2Fsso-saml%2F', 'name' => 'OpenIdP.org', 'img' => '/img/openidp.png'],
 ]

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'login.alternatives' => [],
....

=== Disable ownCloud's built-in CSRF protection mechanism.

In some specific setups CSRF protection is handled in the environment, e.g.,
running F5 ASM. In these cases the built-in mechanism is not needed and can be disabled.
Generally speaking, however, this config switch should be left unchanged.

WARNING: leave this as is if you're not sure what it does

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'csrf.disabled' => false,
....

=== The directory where the skeleton files are located. These files will be
copied to the data directory of new users. Leave empty to not copy any
skeleton files.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'skeletondirectory' => '/path/to/owncloud/core/skeleton',
....

=== The `user_backends` app (which needs to be enabled first) allows you to
configure alternate authentication backends. Supported backends are:
IMAP (OC_User_IMAP), SMB (OC_User_SMB), and FTP (OC_User_FTP).

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'user_backends' => array(
	array(
		'class' => 'OC_User_IMAP',
		'arguments' => array('{imap.gmail.com:993/imap/ssl}INBOX')
	)
),
....

=== If your user backend does not allow password resets (e.g. when it's a read-only
user backend like LDAP), you can specify a custom link, where the user is
redirected to, when clicking the "reset password" link after a failed login-attempt.

In case you do not want to provide any link, replace the url with 'disabled'

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'lost_password_link' => 'https://example.org/link/to/password/reset',
....

=== Allow medial search on account properties like display name, user id, email,
and other search terms. Allows finding 'Alice' when searching for 'lic'.

May slow down user search. Disable this if you encounter slow username search
in the sharing dialog.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'accounts.enable_medial_search' => true,
....

=== Defines the minimum characters entered before a search returns results for
users or groups in the share autocomplete form. Lower values increase search
time especially for large backends.

Any exact matches to a user or group will be returned, even though less than
the minimum characters have been entered. The search is case insensitive.
e.g. entering "tom" will always return "Tom" if there is an exact match.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'user.search_min_length' => 2,
....

== Mail Parameters

These configure the email settings for ownCloud notifications and password resets.

=== The return address that you want to appear on emails sent by the ownCloud server,
for example `oc-admin@example.com`, substituting your own domain, of course.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'mail_domain' => 'example.com',
....

=== FROM address that overrides the built-in `sharing-noreply` and
`lostpassword-noreply` FROM addresses.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'mail_from_address' => 'owncloud',
....

=== Enable SMTP class debugging.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'mail_smtpdebug' => false,
....

=== Which mode to use for sending mail: `sendmail`, `smtp`, `qmail` or `php`.

If you are using local or remote SMTP, set this to `smtp`.

If you are using PHP mail you must have an installed and working email system
on the server. The program used to send email is defined in the `php.ini` file.

For the `sendmail` option you need an installed and working email system on
the server, with `/usr/sbin/sendmail` installed on your Unix system.

For `qmail` the binary is /var/qmail/bin/sendmail, and it must be installed
on your Unix system.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'mail_smtpmode' => 'sendmail',
....

=== This depends on `mail_smtpmode`. Specify the IP address of your mail
server host. This may contain multiple hosts separated by a semi-colon. If
you need to specify the port number append it to the IP address separated by
a colon, like this: `127.0.0.1:24`.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'mail_smtphost' => '127.0.0.1',
....

=== This depends on `mail_smtpmode`. Specify the port for sending mail.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'mail_smtpport' => 25,
....

=== This depends on `mail_smtpmode`. This sets the SMTP server timeout, in seconds.

You may need to increase this if you are running an anti-malware or spam scanner.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'mail_smtptimeout' => 10,
....

=== This depends on `mail_smtpmode`. Specify when you are using `ssl` or
`tls`, or leave empty for no encryption.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'mail_smtpsecure' => '',
....

=== This depends on `mail_smtpmode`. Change this to `true` if your mail
server requires authentication.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'mail_smtpauth' => false,
....

=== This depends on `mail_smtpmode`. If SMTP authentication is required, choose
the authentication type as `LOGIN` (default) or `PLAIN`.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'mail_smtpauthtype' => 'LOGIN',
....

=== This depends on `mail_smtpauth`. Specify the username for authenticating to
the SMTP server.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'mail_smtpname' => '',
....

=== This depends on `mail_smtpauth`. Specify the password for authenticating to
the SMTP server.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'mail_smtppassword' => '',
....

== Proxy Configurations

=== The automatic hostname detection of ownCloud can fail in certain reverse
proxy and CLI/cron situations. This option allows you to manually override
the automatic detection; for example `www.example.com`, or specify the port
`www.example.com:8080`.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'overwritehost' => '',
....

=== When generating URLs, ownCloud attempts to detect whether the server is
accessed via `https` or `http`. However, if ownCloud is behind a proxy
and the proxy handles the `https` calls, ownCloud would not know that
`ssl` is in use, which would result in incorrect URLs being generated.

Valid values are `http` and `https`.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'overwriteprotocol' => '',
....

=== ownCloud attempts to detect the webroot for generating URLs automatically.

For example, if `www.example.com/owncloud` is the URL pointing to the
ownCloud instance, the webroot is `/owncloud`. When proxies are in use, it
may be difficult for ownCloud to detect this parameter, resulting in invalid
URLs.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'overwritewebroot' => '',
....

=== This option allows you to define a manual override condition as a regular
expression for the remote IP address. The keys `overwritewebroot`,
`overwriteprotocol`, and `overwritehost` are subject to this condition.

For example, defining a range of IP  addresses starting with `10.0.0.`
and ending with 1 to 3: * `^10\.0\.0\.[1-3]$`

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'overwritecondaddr' => '',
....

=== Use this configuration parameter to specify the base URL for any URLs which
are generated within ownCloud using any kind of command line tools (cron or
occ). The value should contain the full base URL:
`https://www.example.com/owncloud`
As an example, alerts shown in the browser to upgrade an app are triggered by
a cron background process and therefore uses the url of this key, even if the user
has logged on via a different domain defined in key `trusted_domains`. When the
user clicks an alert like this, he will be redirected to that URL and must logon again.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'overwrite.cli.url' => '',
....

=== To have clean URLs without `/index.php` this parameter needs to be configured.

This parameter will be written as `RewriteBase` on update and installation of
ownCloud to your `.htaccess` file. While this value is often simply the URL
path of the ownCloud installation it cannot be set automatically properly in
every scenario and needs thus some manual configuration.

In a standard Apache setup this usually equals the folder that ownCloud is
accessible at. So if ownCloud is accessible via `https://mycloud.org/owncloud`
the correct value would most likely be `/owncloud`. If ownCloud is running
under `https://mycloud.org/` then it would be `/`.

Note that the above rule is not valid in every case, as there are some rare setup
cases where this may not apply. However, to avoid any update problems this
configuration value is explicitly opt-in.

After setting this value run `occ maintenance:update:htaccess`. Now, when the
following conditions are met ownCloud URLs won't contain `index.php`:

- `mod_rewrite` is installed
- `mod_env` is installed

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'htaccess.RewriteBase' => '/',
....

=== The URL of your proxy server, for example `proxy.example.com:8081`.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'proxy' => '',
....

=== The optional authentication for the proxy to use to connect to the internet.

The format is: `username:password`.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'proxyuserpwd' => '',
....

== Deleted Items (trash bin)

These parameters control the Deleted files app.

=== If the trash bin app is enabled (default), this setting defines the policy
for when files and folders in the trash bin will be permanently deleted.

The app allows for two settings, a minimum time for trash bin retention,
and a maximum time for trash bin retention.
Minimum time is the number of days a file will be kept, after which it
may be deleted. Maximum time is the number of days at which it is guaranteed
to be deleted.
Both minimum and maximum times can be set together to explicitly define
file and folder deletion. For migration purposes, this setting is installed
initially set to `auto`, which is equivalent to the default setting in
ownCloud 8.1 and before.

Available values:

* `auto`
    default setting. Keeps files and folders in the deleted files for up to
    30 days, automatically deleting them (at any time) if space is needed.
    Note: files may not be removed if space is not required.
* `D, auto`
    keeps files and folders in the trash bin for D+ days, delete anytime if
    space needed (note: files may not be deleted if space is not needed)
* `auto, D`
    delete all files in the trash bin that are older than D days
    automatically, delete other files anytime if space needed
* `D1, D2`
    keep files and folders in the trash bin for at least D1 days and
    delete when exceeds D2 days
* `disabled`
    trash bin auto clean disabled, files and folders will be kept forever

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'trashbin_retention_obligation' => 'auto',
....

=== This setting defines percentage of free space occupied by deleted files
that triggers auto purging of deleted files for this user

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'trashbin_purge_limit' => 50,
....

== File versions

These parameters control the Versions app.

=== If the versions app is enabled (default), this setting defines the policy
for when versions will be permanently deleted.

The app allows for two settings, a minimum time for version retention,
and a maximum time for version retention.
Minimum time is the number of days a version will be kept, after which it
may be deleted. Maximum time is the number of days at which it is guaranteed
to be deleted.
Both minimum and maximum times can be set together to explicitly define
version deletion. For migration purposes, this setting is installed
initially set to "auto", which is equivalent to the default setting in
ownCloud 8.1 and before.

Available values:

* `auto`
    default setting. Automatically expire versions according to expire
    rules. Please refer to :doc:`../configuration/files/file_versioning` for
    more information.
* `D, auto`
    keep versions at least for D days, apply expire rules to all versions
    that are older than D days
* `auto, D`
    delete all versions that are older than D days automatically, delete
    other versions according to expire rules
* `D1, D2`
    keep versions for at least D1 days and delete when exceeds D2 days
* `disabled`
    versions auto clean disabled, versions will be kept forever

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'versions_retention_obligation' => 'auto',
....

== ownCloud Verifications

ownCloud performs several verification checks. There are two options,
`true` and `false`.

=== Check if ownCloud is up-to-date and shows a notification if a new version is
available. This option is only applicable to ownCloud core. It is not
applicable to app updates.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'updatechecker' => true,
....

=== URL that ownCloud should use to look for updates

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'updater.server.url' => 'https://updates.owncloud.com/server/',
....

=== Is ownCloud connected to the Internet or running in a closed network?

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'has_internet_connection' => true,
....

=== Allows ownCloud to verify a working .well-known URL redirects. This is done
by attempting to make a request from JS to
https://your-domain.com/.well-known/caldav/

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'check_for_working_wellknown_setup' => true,
....

=== In certain environments it is desired to have a read-only configuration file.

When this switch is set to `true` ownCloud will not verify whether the
configuration is writable. However, it will not be possible to configure
all options via the Web interface. Furthermore, when updating ownCloud
it is required to make the configuration file writable again for the update
process.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'config_is_read_only' => false,
....

=== This defines the mode of operations. The default value is 'single-instance'
which means that ownCloud is running on a single node, which might be the
most common operations mode. The only other possible value for now is
'clustered-instance' which means that ownCloud is running on at least 2
nodes. The mode of operations has various impact on the behavior of ownCloud.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'operation.mode' => 'single-instance',
....

== Logging

These parameters configure the logging options.
For additional information or advanced configuration, please see the logging
section in the documentation.

=== By default the ownCloud logs are sent to the `owncloud.log` file in the
default ownCloud data directory.

If syslogging is desired, set this parameter to `syslog`.
Setting this parameter to `errorlog` will use the PHP error_log function
for logging.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'log_type' => 'owncloud',
....

=== Log file path for the ownCloud logging type.

Defaults to `[datadirectory]/owncloud.log`

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'logfile' => '/var/log/owncloud.log',
....

=== Loglevel to start logging at. Valid values are: 0 = Debug, 1 = Info, 2 =
Warning, 3 = Error, and 4 = Fatal. The default value is Warning.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'loglevel' => 2,
....

=== If you maintain different instances and aggregate the logs, you may want
to distinguish between them. `syslog_tag` can be set per instance
with a unique id. Only available if `log_type` is set to `syslog`.

The default value is `ownCloud`.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'syslog_tag' => 'ownCloud',
....

=== The syslog format can be changed to remove or add information.

In addition to the %replacements% below %level% can be used, but it is used
as a dedicated parameter to the syslog logging facility anyway.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'log.syslog.format' => '[%reqId%][%remoteAddr%][%user%][%app%][%method%][%url%] %message%',
....

=== Log condition for log level increase based on conditions. Once one of these
conditions is met, the required log level is set to debug. This allows to
debug specific requests, users or apps

Supported conditions:
- `shared_secret`: If a request parameter with the name `log_secret` is set to
                    this value the condition is met
- `users`:         If the current request is done by one of the specified users,
                    this condition is met
- `apps`:          If the log message is invoked by one of the specified apps,
                    this condition is met
- `logfile`:       The log message invoked by the specified apps get redirected to
                this logfile, this condition is met
                Note: Not applicable when using syslog.

Defaults to an empty array.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'log.conditions' => [
    [
		'shared_secret' => '57b58edb6637fe3059b3595cf9c41b9',
		'users' => ['user1'],
		'apps' => ['files_texteditor'],
		'logfile' => '/tmp/test.log'
    ],
    [
		'shared_secret' => '57b58edb6637fe3059b3595cf9c41b9',
		'users' => ['user1'],
		'apps' => ['gallery'],
		'logfile' => '/tmp/gallery.log'
    ],
],
....

=== This uses PHP.date formatting; see http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'logdateformat' => 'F d, Y H:i:s',
....

=== The default timezone for logfiles is UTC. You may change this; see
http://php.net/manual/en/timezones.php

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'logtimezone' => 'Europe/Berlin',
....

=== Log successful cron runs.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'cron_log' => true,
....

=== Enables log rotation and limits the total size of the logfiles.

The default is 0 or false which disables log rotation.
Specify a size in bytes, for example 104857600
(100 megabytes = 100 * 1024 * 1024 bytes).
A new logfile is created with a new name when the old logfile reaches the defined limit.
If a rotated log file is already present, it will be overwritten.
If enabled, only the active log file and one rotated file are stored.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'log_rotate_size' => false,
....

== Alternate Code Locations

Some of the ownCloud code may be stored in alternate locations.

=== If you want to store apps in a custom directory instead of ownCloud’s default
`/apps`, you need to modify the `apps_paths` key. There, you need to add a
new associative array that contains three elements. These are:

- `path`      The absolute file system path to the custom app folder.
- `url`       The request path to that folder relative to the ownCloud web root, prefixed with /.
- `writable`  Whether users can install apps in that folder. After the configuration is added,
              new apps will only install in a directory where writable is set to true.

The configuration example shows how to add a second directory, called `/apps-external`.
Here, new apps and updates are only written to the `/apps-external` directory.
This eases upgrade procedures of owncloud where shipped apps are delivered to apps/ by default.
`OC::$SERVERROOT` points to the web root of your instance.
Please see the Apps Management description on how to move custom apps properly.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'apps_paths' =>
array (
  0 => 
  array (
    'path' => OC::$SERVERROOT.'/apps',
    'url' => '/apps',
    'writable' => false,
  ),
  1 => 
  array (
    'path' => OC::$SERVERROOT.'/apps-external',
    'url' => '/apps-external',
    'writable' => true,
  ),
),
....

== Previews

ownCloud supports previews of image files, the covers of MP3 files, and text
files. These options control enabling and disabling previews, and thumbnail
size.

=== By default, ownCloud can generate previews for the following filetypes:

- Image files
- Covers of MP3 files
- Text documents

Valid values are `true`, to enable previews, or `false`, to disable previews

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'enable_previews' => true,
....

=== The maximum width, in pixels, of a preview. A value of `null` means there
is no limit.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'preview_max_x' => 2048,
....

=== The maximum height, in pixels, of a preview.

A value of `null` means there is no limit.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'preview_max_y' => 2048,
....

=== If a lot of small pictures are stored on the ownCloud instance and the
preview system generates blurry previews, you might want to consider setting
a maximum scale factor. By default, pictures are upscaled to 10 times the
original size. A value of `1` or `null` disables scaling.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'preview_max_scale_factor' => 10,
....

=== max file size for generating image previews with imagegd (default behaviour)
If the image is bigger, it'll try other preview generators,
but will most likely show the default mimetype icon

Value represents the maximum filesize in megabytes
Default is 50
Set to -1 for no limit

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'preview_max_filesize_image' => 50,
....

=== custom path for LibreOffice/OpenOffice binary

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'preview_libreoffice_path' => '/usr/bin/libreoffice',
....

=== Use this if LibreOffice/OpenOffice requires additional arguments.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'preview_office_cl_parameters' =>
	' --headless --nologo --nofirststartwizard --invisible --norestore '.
	'--convert-to pdf --outdir ',
....

	'OC\Preview\BMP',
	'OC\Preview\XBitmap',
	'OC\Preview\MP3',
	'OC\Preview\TXT',
	'OC\Preview\MarkDown'
),
....

== Comments

Global settings for the Comments infrastructure

=== Replaces the default Comments Manager Factory. This can be utilized if an
own or 3rdParty CommentsManager should be used that – for instance – uses the
filesystem instead of the database to keep the comments.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'comments.managerFactory' => '\OC\Comments\ManagerFactory',
....

=== Replaces the default System Tags Manager Factory. This can be utilized if an
own or 3rdParty SystemTagsManager should be used that – for instance – uses the
filesystem instead of the database to keep the tags.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'systemtags.managerFactory' => '\OC\SystemTag\ManagerFactory',
....

== Maintenance

These options are for halting user activity when you are performing server
maintenance.

=== Enable maintenance mode to disable ownCloud

If you want to prevent users from logging in to ownCloud before you start
doing some maintenance work, you need to set the value of the maintenance
parameter to true. Please keep in mind that users who are already logged-in
are kicked out of ownCloud instantly.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'maintenance' => false,
....

=== When set to `true`, the ownCloud instance will be unavailable for all users
who are not in the `admin` group.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'singleuser' => false,
....

== SSL

=== Extra SSL options to be used for configuration.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'openssl' => array(
	'config' => '/absolute/location/of/openssl.cnf',
),
....

=== Allow the configuration of system wide trusted certificates

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'enable_certificate_management' => false,
....

== Memory caching backend configuration

Available cache backends:

* `\OC\Memcache\APCu`       APC user backend
* `\OC\Memcache\ArrayCache` In-memory array-based backend (not recommended)
* `\OC\Memcache\Memcached`  Memcached backend
* `\OC\Memcache\Redis`      Redis backend

Advice on choosing between the various backends:

* APCu should be easiest to install. Almost all distributions have packages.
  Use this for single user environment for all caches.
* Use Redis or Memcached for distributed environments.
  For the local cache (you can configure two) take APCu.

=== Memory caching backend for locally stored data

* Used for host-specific data, e.g. file paths

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'memcache.local' => '\OC\Memcache\APCu',
....

=== Memory caching backend for distributed data

* Used for installation-specific data, e.g. database caching
* If unset, defaults to the value of memcache.local

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'memcache.distributed' => '\OC\Memcache\Memcached',
....

=== Connection details for redis to use for memory caching in a single server configuration.

For enhanced security it is recommended to configure Redis to require a password.
See http://redis.io/topics/security for more information.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'redis' => [
	'host' => 'localhost', // can also be a unix domain socket: '/tmp/redis.sock'
	'port' => 6379,
	'timeout' => 0.0,
	'password' => '', // Optional, if not defined no password will be used.
	'dbindex' => 0,   // Optional, if undefined SELECT will not run and will use Redis Server's default DB Index.
],
....

=== Connection details for a Redis Cluster

Only for use with Redis Clustering, for Sentinel-based setups use the single
server configuration above, and perform HA on the hostname.

Redis Cluster support requires the php module phpredis in version 3.0.0 or higher.

Available failover modes:
- \RedisCluster::FAILOVER_NONE       - only send commands to master nodes (default)
- \RedisCluster::FAILOVER_ERROR      - failover to slaves for read commands if master is unavailable
- \RedisCluster::FAILOVER_DISTRIBUTE - randomly distribute read commands across master and slaves

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'redis.cluster' => [
	'seeds' => [ // provide some/all of the cluster servers to bootstrap discovery, port required
		'localhost:7000',
		'localhost:7001'
	],
	'timeout' => 0.0,
	'read_timeout' => 0.0,
	'failover_mode' => \RedisCluster::FAILOVER_DISTRIBUTE
],
....

=== Server details for one or more memcached servers to use for memory caching.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'memcached_servers' => array(
	// hostname, port and optional weight. Also see:
	// http://www.php.net/manual/en/memcached.addservers.php
	// http://www.php.net/manual/en/memcached.addserver.php
	array('localhost', 11211),
	//array('other.host.local', 11211),
),
....

=== Connection options for memcached, see http://apprize.info/php/scaling/15.html

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'memcached_options' => array(
	// Set timeouts to 50ms
	\Memcached::OPT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT => 50,
	\Memcached::OPT_RETRY_TIMEOUT =>   50,
	\Memcached::OPT_SEND_TIMEOUT =>    50,
	\Memcached::OPT_RECV_TIMEOUT =>    50,
	\Memcached::OPT_POLL_TIMEOUT =>    50,

	// Enable compression
	\Memcached::OPT_COMPRESSION =>          true,

	// Turn on consistent hashing
	\Memcached::OPT_LIBKETAMA_COMPATIBLE => true,

	// Enable Binary Protocol
	\Memcached::OPT_BINARY_PROTOCOL =>      true,

	// Binary serializer will be enabled if the igbinary PECL module is available
	//\Memcached::OPT_SERIALIZER => \Memcached::SERIALIZER_IGBINARY,
),
....

=== Location of the cache folder, defaults to `data/$user/cache` where
`$user` is the current user. When specified, the format will change to
`$cache_path/$user` where `$cache_path` is the configured cache directory
and `$user` is the user.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'cache_path' => '',
....

=== TTL of chunks located in the cache folder before they're removed by
garbage collection (in seconds). Increase this value if users have
issues uploading very large files via the ownCloud Client as upload isn't
completed within one day.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'cache_chunk_gc_ttl' => 86400, // 60*60*24 = 1 day
....

=== Location of the chunk folder, defaults to `data/$user/uploads` where
`$user` is the current user. When specified, the format will change to
`$dav.chunk_base_dir/$user` where `$dav.chunk_base_dir` is the configured
cache directory and `$user` is the user.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'dav.chunk_base_dir' => '',
....

== Sharing

Global settings for Sharing

=== Replaces the default Share Provider Factory. This can be utilized if
own or 3rdParty Share Providers are used that – for instance – use the
filesystem instead of the database to keep the share information.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'sharing.managerFactory' => '\OC\Share20\ProviderFactory',
....

=== When talking with federated sharing server, allow falling back to HTTP
instead of hard forcing HTTPS

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'sharing.federation.allowHttpFallback' => false,
....

== All other configuration options

=== Additional driver options for the database connection, eg. to enable SSL
encryption in MySQL or specify a custom wait timeout on a cheap hoster.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'dbdriveroptions' => array(
	PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_SSL_CA => '/file/path/to/ca_cert.pem',
	PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_INIT_COMMAND => 'SET wait_timeout = 28800'
),
....

=== sqlite3 journal mode can be specified using this configuration parameter -
can be 'WAL' or 'DELETE' see for more details https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'sqlite.journal_mode' => 'DELETE',
....

=== During setup, if requirements are met (see below), this setting is set to true
and MySQL can handle 4 byte characters instead of 3 byte characters.

If you want to convert an existing 3-byte setup into a 4-byte setup please
set the parameters in MySQL as mentioned below and run the migration command:
`sudo -u www-data php occ db:convert-mysql-charset`
The config setting will be set automatically after a successful run.

Consult the documentation for more details.

MySQL requires a special setup for longer indexes (> 767 bytes) which are needed:

[source,console]
....
[mysqld]
innodb_large_prefix=ON
innodb_file_format=Barracuda
innodb_file_per_table=ON
....

Tables will be created with
 * character set: utf8mb4
 * collation:     utf8mb4_bin
 * row_format:    compressed

See:
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/charset-unicode-utf8mb4.html

http://mechanics.flite.com/blog/2014/07/29/using-innodb-large-prefix-to-avoid-error-1071/

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'mysql.utf8mb4' => false,
....

=== Database types that are supported for installation.

Available:
- sqlite (SQLite3 - Not in Enterprise Edition)
- mysql (MySQL)
- pgsql (PostgreSQL)
- oci (Oracle - Enterprise Edition Only)

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'supportedDatabases' => array(
	'sqlite',
	'mysql',
	'pgsql',
	'oci',
),
....

=== Override where ownCloud stores temporary files. Useful in situations where
the system temporary directory is on a limited space ramdisk or is otherwise
restricted, or if external storages which do not support streaming are in use.

The Web server user must have write access to this directory.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'tempdirectory' => '/tmp/owncloudtemp',
....

=== The hashing cost used by hashes generated by ownCloud.

Using a higher value requires more time and CPU power to calculate the hashes.
As this number grows, the amount of work (typically CPU time or memory) necessary
to compute the hash increases exponentially.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'hashingCost' => 10,
....

=== Blacklist a specific file or files and disallow the upload of files
with this name. `.htaccess` is blocked by default.

WARNING: USE THIS ONLY IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'blacklisted_files' => array('.htaccess'),
....

=== Exclude specific directory names and disallow scanning, creating and renaming
using these names. Case insensitive.

Excluded directory names are queried at any path part like at the beginning,
in the middle or at the end and will not be further processed if found.
Please see the documentation for details and examples.
Use when the storage backend supports eg snapshot directories to be excluded.
WARNING: USE THIS ONLY IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'excluded_directories' =>
	array (
		'.snapshot',
		'~snapshot',
	),
....

=== Exclude files from the integrity checker command

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'integrity.excluded.files' =>
	array (
		'.DS_Store',
		'Thumbs.db',
		'.directory',
		'.webapp',
		'.htaccess',
		'.user.ini',
	),
....

=== The list of apps that are allowed to have no signature.json. Besides
ownCloud apps, this is particularly useful when creating ownCloud themes,
because themes are treated as apps. The app is identified with it´s app-id.

The following example allows app-1 and theme-2 to have no signature.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'integrity.ignore.missing.app.signature' =>
	array(
		'app-id of app-1',
		'app-id of theme-2',
	),
....

=== Define a default folder for shared files and folders other than root.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'share_folder' => '/',
....

=== The default cipher for encrypting files. Currently AES-128-CFB and
AES-256-CFB are supported.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'cipher' => 'AES-256-CFB',
....

=== The minimum ownCloud desktop client version that will be allowed to sync with
this server instance. All connections made from earlier clients will be denied
by the server. Defaults to the minimum officially supported ownCloud version at
the time of release of this server version.

When changing this, note that older unsupported versions of the ownCloud desktop
client may not function as expected, and could lead to permanent data loss for
clients or other unexpected results.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'minimum.supported.desktop.version' => '2.3.3',
....

=== EXPERIMENTAL: option whether to include external storage in quota
calculation, defaults to false.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'quota_include_external_storage' => false,
....

=== Specifies how often the local filesystem (the ownCloud data/ directory, and
NFS mounts in data/) is checked for changes made outside ownCloud. This
does not apply to external storages.

-> Never check the filesystem for outside changes, provides a performance
increase when it's certain that no changes are made directly to the
filesystem

-> Check each file or folder at most once per request, recommended for
general use if outside changes might happen.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'filesystem_check_changes' => 0,
....

=== By default ownCloud will store the part files created during upload in the
same storage as the upload target. Setting this to false will store the part
files in the root of the users folder which might be required to work with certain
external storage setups that have limited rename capabilities.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'part_file_in_storage' => true,
....

=== Where `mount.json` file should be stored, defaults to `data/mount.json`
in the ownCloud directory.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'mount_file' => '/var/www/owncloud/data/mount.json',
....

=== When `true`, prevent ownCloud from changing the cache due to changes in the
filesystem for all storage.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'filesystem_cache_readonly' => false,
....

=== Secret used by ownCloud for various purposes, e.g. to encrypt data. If you
lose this string there will be data corruption.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'secret' => '',
....

=== List of trusted proxy servers

If you configure these also consider setting `forwarded_for_headers` which
otherwise defaults to `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` (the `X-Forwarded-For` header).

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'trusted_proxies' => array('203.0.113.45', '198.51.100.128'),
....

=== Headers that should be trusted as client IP address in combination with
`trusted_proxies`. If the HTTP header looks like 'X-Forwarded-For', then use
'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR' here.

If set incorrectly, a client can spoof their IP address as visible to
ownCloud, bypassing access controls and making logs useless!

Defaults to 'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR' if unset

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'forwarded_for_headers' => array('HTTP_X_FORWARDED', 'HTTP_FORWARDED_FOR'),
....

=== max file size for animating gifs on public-sharing-site.

If the gif is bigger, it'll show a static preview

Value represents the maximum filesize in megabytes.
Default is `10`. Set to `-1` for no limit.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'max_filesize_animated_gifs_public_sharing' => 10,
....

=== Enables transactional file locking.

This is enabled by default.

Prevents concurrent processes from accessing the same files
at the same time. Can help prevent side effects that would
be caused by concurrent operations. Mainly relevant for
very large installations with many users working with
shared files.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'filelocking.enabled' => true,
....

=== Set the lock's time-to-live in seconds.

Any lock older than this will be automatically cleaned up.
If not set this defaults to either 1 hour or the php max_execution_time, whichever is higher.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'filelocking.ttl' => 3600,
....

=== Memory caching backend for file locking

Because most memcache backends can clean values without warning using redis
is highly recommended to *avoid data loss*.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'memcache.locking' => '\\OC\\Memcache\\Redis',
....

=== Disable the web based updater

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'upgrade.disable-web' => false,
....

=== Automatic update of market apps, set to "false" to disable.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'upgrade.automatic-app-update' => true,
....

=== Set this ownCloud instance to debugging mode

Only enable this for local development and not in production environments
This will disable the minifier and outputs some additional debug information

WARNING::
   Be warned that, if you set this to `true`, exceptions display
   stack traces on the web interface, *including passwords*, — **in plain text!**.
   We strongly encourage you never to use it in production.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'debug' => false,
....

=== Sets the data-fingerprint of the current data served

This is a property used by the clients to find out if a backup has been
restored on the server. Once a backup is restored run
./occ maintenance:data-fingerprint
To set this to a new value.

Updating/Deleting this value can make connected clients stall until
the user has resolved conflicts.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'data-fingerprint' => '',
....

=== This entry is just here to show a warning in case somebody copied the sample
configuration. DO NOT ADD THIS SWITCH TO YOUR CONFIGURATION!

If you, brave person, have read until here be aware that you should not
modify *ANY* settings in this file without reading the documentation.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'copied_sample_config' => true,
....

=== Set this property to true if you want to enable the files_external local mount Option.

Default: `false`

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'files_external_allow_create_new_local' => false,
....

=== Set this property to true if you want to enable debug logging for SMB access.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'smb.logging.enable' => false,
....

=== Async dav extensions can be enabled or disabled.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'dav.enable.async' => false,
....
