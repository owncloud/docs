= Config.php Parameters
:toc: right

== Introduction

ownCloud uses the `config/config.php` file to control server operations.
`config/config.sample.php` lists all the configurable parameters within
ownCloud, along with example or default values. This document provides a
more detailed reference. Most options are configurable on your Admin
page, so it is usually not necessary to edit `config/config.php`.

NOTE: The installer creates a configuration containing the essential parameters. +
Only manually add configuration parameters to `config/config.php` if you need to use a special
value for a parameter. *Do not copy everything from* `config/config.sample.php` *.
Only enter the parameters you wish to modify!*

ownCloud supports loading configuration parameters from multiple files.
You can add arbitrary files ending with .config.php in the config/
directory, for example you could place your email server configuration
in email.config.php. This allows you to easily create and manage custom
configurations, or to divide a large complex configuration file into a
set of smaller files. These custom files are not overwritten by
ownCloud, and the values in these files take precedence over config.php.

// header end do not delete or edit this line

== Default Parameters

These parameters are configured by the ownCloud installer, and are required
for your ownCloud server to operate.

=== A unique identifier for your ownCloud installation, created automatically by the installer.

This example is for documentation only, and you should never use it because it will not work.
A valid `instanceid` is created when you install ownCloud. Needs to start with a letter.

'instanceid' => 'd3c944a9a',

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'instanceid' => '',
....

=== The salt used to hash all passwords, auto-generated by the ownCloud installer.

(There are also per-user salts.) If you lose this salt you lose all your
passwords. This example is for documentation only, and you should never use it.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'passwordsalt' => '',
....

=== List of trusted domains that users can log into.

Specifying trusted domains prevents host header poisoning.
Do not remove this, as it performs necessary security checks.
Please consider that for backend processes like background jobs or occ commands,
the url parameter in key `overwrite.cli.url` is used. For more details please see that key.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'trusted_domains' => [
	'demo.example.org',
	'otherdomain.example.org',
  ],
....

=== The global list of CORS domains.

All users can use tools running CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) requests
from the listed domains.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'cors.allowed-domains' => [
	'https://foo.example.org',
  ],
....

=== Directory where user files are stored.

This defaults to `data/` in the ownCloud directory.
The SQLite database is also stored here, when you use SQLite.
(SQLite is not available in ownCloud Enterprise Edition)

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'datadirectory' => '/var/www/owncloud/data',
....

=== Current version number of your ownCloud installation.

This is set up during installation and update, so you shouldn't need to change it.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'version' => '',
....

=== Hardening an ownCloud instance by hiding the version information in `status.php`.

This can be a legitimate step. Please consult the documentation before enabling this.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'version.hide' => false,
....

=== Show or hide the hostname of the server in `status.php`.

Optional config option, defaults to hidden.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'show_server_hostname' => false,
....

=== Use the short hostname in `status.php`.

Optional config option, defaults to use the gethostname() return value.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'use_relative_domain_name' => false,
....

=== Identifies the database used with this installation.

See also config option `supportedDatabases`

Available:
- sqlite (SQLite3 - Not in Enterprise Edition)
- mysql (MySQL/MariaDB)
- pgsql (PostgreSQL)
- oci (Oracle - Enterprise Edition Only)

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'dbtype' => 'sqlite',
....

=== Defines the database server host name.

For example `localhost`, `hostname`, `hostname.example.com`, or the IP address.
To specify a port use: `hostname:####`;
To specify a Unix socket use: `localhost:/path/to/socket`.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'dbhost' => '',
....

=== Defines the ownCloud database name during installation.

The name of the ownCloud database which is set during installation.
You should not need to change this.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'dbname' => 'owncloud',
....

=== Defines the ownCloud database user for this installation.

This must be unique across ownCloud instances using the same SQL database.
This is setup during installation, so you shouldn't need to change it.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'dbuser' => '',
....

=== Defines the password for the database user.

This is set up during installation, so you shouldn't need to change it.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'dbpassword' => '',
....

=== Prefix for the ownCloud tables in the database.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'dbtableprefix' => '',
....

=== Indicates whether the ownCloud instance was installed successfully.

`true` indicates a successful installation,
`false` indicates an unsuccessful installation.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'installed' => false,
....

== User Experience

These optional parameters control some aspects of the user interface. Default
values, where present, are shown.

=== Define the default language on your ownCloud server.

Using ISO_639-1 language codes such as `en` for English, `de` for German, and `fr` for French.
Overrides automatic language detection on public pages like login or shared items.
User's language preferences configured under `personal -> language` override
this setting after they have logged in.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'default_language' => 'en_GB',
....

=== Define the default app to open on login.

Use the app names as they appear in the URL after clicking them in the Apps menu,
such as files, documents or calendar ect. You can use a comma-separated list of app names,
so if the first app is not enabled for a user then ownCloud will try the second one, and so
on. If no enabled apps are found it defaults to the Files app.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'defaultapp' => 'files',
....

=== Enables or removes the Help menu item in the user menu.

The Help menue can be found in top right of the ownCloud Web interface.
`true` enables the Help menu item, `false` removes the help item.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'knowledgebaseenabled' => true,
....

=== Enables or disable  avatars or user profile photos.

`true` enables avatars, or user profile photos, `false` disables them.
These appear on the User page, on user's Personal pages and are used by some apps
(contacts, mail, etc).

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'enable_avatars' => true,
....

=== Allow or disallow users to change their display names.

`true` allows users to change their display names (on their Personal pages),
`false` prevents them from changing their display names.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'allow_user_to_change_display_name' => true,
....

=== Lifetime of the remember login cookie.

The remember login cookie is set when the user clicks the `remember` checkbox
on the login screen. The default is 15 days, expressed in seconds.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'remember_login_cookie_lifetime' => 60*60*24*15,
....

=== The lifetime of a session after inactivity.

The default is 20 minutes, expressed in seconds.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'session_lifetime' => 60 * 20,
....

=== Enable or disable session keep-alive when a user is logged in to the Web UI.

Enabling this sends a "heartbeat" to the server to keep it from timing out.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'session_keepalive' => true,
....

=== Enforces token only authentication for apps and clients connecting to ownCloud.

If enabled, all access requests using the users password are blocked for enhanced security.
Users have to generate special app-passwords (tokens) for their apps or clients in their personal
settings which are further used for app or client authentication. Browser logon is not affected.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'token_auth_enforced' => false,
....

=== Allows to specify additional login buttons on the logon screen for e.g. SSO integration.

'login.alternatives' => [
  ['href' => 'https://www.testshib.org/Shibboleth.sso/ProtectNetwork?target=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.owncloud.tld%2Flogin%2Fsso-saml%2F', 'name' => 'ProtectNetwork', 'img' => '/img/PN_sign-in.gif'],
  ['href' => 'https://www.testshib.org/Shibboleth.sso/OpenIdP.org?target=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.owncloud.tld%2Flogin%2Fsso-saml%2F', 'name' => 'OpenIdP.org', 'img' => '/img/openidp.png'],
]

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'login.alternatives' => [],
....

=== Enable or disable ownCloud's built-in CSRF protection mechanism.

In some specific setups CSRF protection is handled in the environment, e.g.,
running F5 ASM. In these cases the built-in mechanism is not needed and can be disabled.
Generally speaking, however, this config switch should be left unchanged.

WARNING: leave this as is if you're not sure what it does.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'csrf.disabled' => false,
....

=== Define the directory where the skeleton files are located.

These files will be copied to the data directory of new users.
Leave empty to not copy any skeleton files.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'skeletondirectory' => '/path/to/owncloud/core/skeleton',
....

=== Defines the `user_backends` app.

Those need to be enabled first and allow you to configure alternate authentication backends.
Supported backends are:
IMAP (OC_User_IMAP), SMB (OC_User_SMB), and FTP (OC_User_FTP).

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'user_backends' => [
	[
		'class' => 'OC_User_IMAP',
		'arguments' => ['{imap.gmail.com:993/imap/ssl}INBOX')]
	]
  ],
....

=== Define a custom link to reset password.

If your user backend does not allow password resets (e.g. when it's a read-only
user backend like LDAP), you can specify a custom link, where the user is
redirected to, when clicking the "reset password" link after a failed login-attempt.
In case you do not want to provide any link, replace the url with 'disabled'

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'lost_password_link' => 'https://example.org/link/to/password/reset',
....

=== Allow medial search on account properties.

These account properties can be display name, user id, email, and other search terms.
Allows finding 'Alice' when searching for 'lic'. May slow down user search.
Disable this if you encounter slow username search in the sharing dialog.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'accounts.enable_medial_search' => true,
....

=== Allow medial search on the group id.

Allows finding 'test' in groups when searching for 'es'.
This is only used in the DB group backend (local groups).
This won't be used against LDAP, Shibboleth or any other group backend.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'groups.enable_medial_search' => true,
....

=== Minimum characters entered before a search returns results.

Defines the minimum characters entered before a search returns results for
users or groups in the share autocomplete form. Lower values increase search
time especially for large backends.
Any exact matches to a user or group will be returned, even though less than
the minimum characters have been entered. The search is case insensitive.
e.g. entering "tom" will always return "Tom" if there is an exact match.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'user.search_min_length' => 2,
....

== Mail Parameters

These configure the email settings for ownCloud notifications and password resets.

=== Define the email RETURN address.

The return address that you want to appear on emails sent by the ownCloud server.
Example: `oc-admin@example.com`, substituting your own domain, of course.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'mail_domain' => 'example.com',
....

=== Define the email FROM address.

FROM address that overrides the built-in `sharing-noreply` and
`lostpassword-noreply` FROM addresses.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'mail_from_address' => 'owncloud',
....

=== Enable or disable SMTP class debugging.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'mail_smtpdebug' => false,
....

=== Define the mode for sending an email.

Modes to use for sending mail: `sendmail`, `smtp`, `qmail` or `php`.

If you are using local or remote SMTP, set this to `smtp`.

If you are using PHP mail you must have an installed and working email system
on the server. The program used to send email is defined in the `php.ini` file.

For the `sendmail` option you need an installed and working email system on
the server, with `/usr/sbin/sendmail` installed on your Unix system.

For `qmail` the binary is /var/qmail/bin/sendmail, and it must be installed
on your Unix system.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'mail_smtpmode' => 'sendmail',
....

=== Specify the IP address of your mail server host.

Depends on `mail_smtpmode`. May contain multiple hosts separated by a semi-colon.
If you need to specify the port number, append it to the IP address separated by
a colon, like this: `127.0.0.1:24`.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'mail_smtphost' => '127.0.0.1',
....

=== Define the port for sending an email.

Depends on `mail_smtpmode`.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'mail_smtpport' => 25,
....

=== Define the SMTP server timeout.

Depends on `mail_smtpmode`. Sets the SMTP server timeout in seconds.
You may need to increase this if you are running an anti-malware or spam scanner.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'mail_smtptimeout' => 10,
....

=== Define the SMTP security style.

Depends on `mail_smtpmode`. Specify when you are using `ssl` or `tls`.
Leave empty for no encryption.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'mail_smtpsecure' => '',
....

=== Define the SMTP authentication.

Depends on `mail_smtpmode`. Change this to `true` if your mail server requires authentication.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'mail_smtpauth' => false,
....

=== Define the SMTP authentication type.

Depends on `mail_smtpmode`. If SMTP authentication is required,
choose the authentication type as `LOGIN` (default) or `PLAIN`.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'mail_smtpauthtype' => 'LOGIN',
....

=== Specify SMTP authentication username.

Depends on `mail_smtpauth`. Specify the username for authenticating to the SMTP server.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'mail_smtpname' => '',
....

=== Define the SMTP authentication password.

Depends on `mail_smtpauth`. Specify the password for authenticating to the SMTP server.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'mail_smtppassword' => '',
....

== Proxy Configurations

=== Override automatic proxy detection.

The automatic hostname detection of ownCloud can fail in certain reverse
proxy and CLI/cron situations. This option allows you to manually override
the automatic detection; for example `www.example.com`, or specify the port
`www.example.com:8080`.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'overwritehost' => '',
....

=== Override protocol usage.

When generating URLs, ownCloud attempts to detect whether the server is
accessed via `https` or `http`. However, if ownCloud is behind a proxy
and the proxy handles the `https` calls, ownCloud would not know that
`ssl` is in use, which would result in incorrect URLs being generated.
Valid values are `http` and `https`.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'overwriteprotocol' => '',
....

=== Override webroot.

ownCloud attempts to detect the webroot for generating URLs automatically.
For example, if `www.example.com/owncloud` is the URL pointing to the
ownCloud instance, the webroot is `/owncloud`. When proxies are in use, it
may be difficult for ownCloud to detect this parameter, resulting in invalid URLs.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'overwritewebroot' => '',
....

=== Override condition.

This option allows you to define a manual override condition as a regular
expression for the remote IP address. The keys `overwritewebroot`,
`overwriteprotocol`, and `overwritehost` are subject to this condition.
For example, defining a range of IP  addresses starting with `10.0.0.`
and ending with 1 to 3: * `^10\.0\.0\.[1-3]$`

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'overwritecondaddr' => '',
....

=== Override cli URL.

Use this configuration parameter to specify the base URL for any URLs which
are generated within ownCloud using any kind of command line tools (cron or occ).
The value should contain the full base URL: `https://www.example.com/owncloud`
As an example, alerts shown in the browser to upgrade an app are triggered by
a cron background process and therefore uses the url of this key, even if the user
has logged on via a different domain defined in key `trusted_domains`. When the
user clicks an alert like this, he will be redirected to that URL and must logon again.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'overwrite.cli.url' => '',
....

=== Define phoenix base URL
If phoenix.baseUrl is set, public and private links will be redirected to this url.

Phoenix will handle these links accordingly.

As an example, in case 'phoenix.baseUrl' is set to 'http://phoenix.example.com',
the shared link 'http://ocx.example.com/index.php/s/THoQjwYYMJvXMdW' will be redirected
by ownCloud to 'http://phoenix.example.com/index.html#/s/THoQjwYYMJvXMdW'.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'phoenix.baseUrl' => '',
....

=== Define clean URLs without `/index.php`.

This parameter will be written as `RewriteBase` on update and installation of
ownCloud to your `.htaccess` file. While this value is often simply the URL
path of the ownCloud installation it cannot be set automatically properly in
every scenario and needs thus some manual configuration.

In a standard Apache setup this usually equals the folder that ownCloud is
accessible at. So if ownCloud is accessible via `https://mycloud.org/owncloud`
the correct value would most likely be `/owncloud`. If ownCloud is running
under `https://mycloud.org/` then it would be `/`.

Note that the above rule is not valid in every case, as there are some rare setup
cases where this may not apply. However, to avoid any update problems this
configuration value is explicitly opt-in.

After setting this value run `{occ-command-example-prefix} maintenance:update:htaccess`. Now, when the
following conditions are met ownCloud URLs won't contain `index.php`:

- `mod_rewrite` is installed
- `mod_env` is installed

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'htaccess.RewriteBase' => '/',
....

=== Define the URL of your proxy server.

Example: `proxy.example.com:8081`.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'proxy' => '',
....

=== Define proxy authentication
The optional authentication for the proxy to use to connect to the internet.

The format is: `username:password`.

The username and the password need to be urlencoded to avoid breaking the
delimiter syntax "username:password@hostname:port

Example: `usern@me` needs to be encoded as `usern%40ame`.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'proxyuserpwd' => '',
....

== Deleted Items (trash bin)

These parameters control the Deleted files app.

=== Define the trashbin retention obligation.

If the trash bin app is enabled (default), this setting defines the policy
for when files and folders in the trash bin will be permanently deleted.
The app allows for two settings, a minimum time for trash bin retention,
and a maximum time for trash bin retention.
Minimum time is the number of days a file will be kept, after which it may be deleted.
Maximum time is the number of days at which it is guaranteed to be deleted.
Both minimum and maximum times can be set together to explicitly define
file and folder deletion. For migration purposes, this setting is installed
initially set to `auto`, which is equivalent to the default setting in
ownCloud 8.1 and before.

Available values:

* `auto`
    default setting. Keeps files and folders in the deleted files for up to
    30 days, automatically deleting them (at any time) if space is needed.
    Note: files may not be removed if space is not required.
* `D, auto`
    keeps files and folders in the trash bin for D+ days, delete anytime if
    space needed (note: files may not be deleted if space is not needed)
* `auto, D`
    delete all files in the trash bin that are older than D days
    automatically, delete other files anytime if space needed
* `D1, D2`
    keep files and folders in the trash bin for at least D1 days and
    delete when exceeds D2 days
* `disabled`
    trash bin auto clean disabled, files and folders will be kept forever

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'trashbin_retention_obligation' => 'auto',
....

=== Define the trashbin purge limit
This setting defines percentage of free space occupied by deleted files
that triggers auto purging of deleted files for this user

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'trashbin_purge_limit' => 50,
....

== File versions

These parameters control the Versions app.

=== Define the files versions retention obligation.

If the versions app is enabled (default), this setting defines the policy
for when versions will be permanently deleted.
The app allows for two settings, a minimum time for version retention,
and a maximum time for version retention.
Minimum time is the number of days a version will be kept, after which it
may be deleted. Maximum time is the number of days at which it is guaranteed
to be deleted.
Both minimum and maximum times can be set together to explicitly define
version deletion. For migration purposes, this setting is installed
initially set to "auto", which is equivalent to the default setting in
ownCloud 8.1 and before.

Available values:

* `auto`
    default setting. Automatically expire versions according to expire
    rules. Please refer to :doc:`../configuration/files/file_versioning` for
    more information.
* `D, auto`
    keep versions at least for D days, apply expire rules to all versions
    that are older than D days
* `auto, D`
    delete all versions that are older than D days automatically, delete
    other versions according to expire rules
* `D1, D2`
    keep versions for at least D1 days and delete when exceeds D2 days
* `disabled`
    versions auto clean disabled, versions will be kept forever

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'versions_retention_obligation' => 'auto',
....

== ownCloud Verifications

ownCloud performs several verification checks. There are two options,
`true` and `false`.

=== Enable or disable Updatechecker.

Check if ownCloud is up-to-date and shows a notification if a new version is available.
This option is only applicable to ownCloud core. It is not applicable to app updates.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'updatechecker' => true,
....

=== Define the updatechecker URL.

URL that ownCloud should use to look for updates

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'updater.server.url' => 'https://updates.owncloud.com/server/',
....

=== Check for an internet connection.

Is ownCloud connected to the Internet or running in a closed network?

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'has_internet_connection' => true,
....

=== Check for a `.well-known` setup.

Allows ownCloud to verify a working .well-known URL redirects.
This is done by attempting to make a request from JS to
`https://your-domain.com/.well-known/caldav/`

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'check_for_working_wellknown_setup' => true,
....

=== Define if config.php is read only.

In certain environments it is desired to have a read-only configuration file.
When this switch is set to `true` ownCloud will not verify whether the
configuration is writable. However, it will not be possible to configure
all options via the Web interface. Furthermore, when updating ownCloud
it is required to make the configuration file writable again for the update
process.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'config_is_read_only' => false,
....

=== Define ownCloud operation modes.

This defines the mode of operations. The default value is 'single-instance'
which means that ownCloud is running on a single node, which might be the
most common operations mode. The only other possible value for now is
'clustered-instance' which means that ownCloud is running on at least 2
nodes. The mode of operations has various impact on the behavior of ownCloud.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'operation.mode' => 'single-instance',
....

== Logging

These parameters configure the logging options.
For additional information or advanced configuration, please see the logging
section in the documentation.

=== Define the log type.

By default the ownCloud logs are sent to the `owncloud.log` file in the
default ownCloud data directory.
If syslogging is desired, set this parameter to `syslog`.
Setting this parameter to `errorlog` will use the PHP error_log function
for logging.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'log_type' => 'owncloud',
....

=== Define the log path.

Log file path for the ownCloud logging type.
Defaults to `[datadirectory]/owncloud.log`

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'logfile' => '/var/log/owncloud.log',
....

=== Define the log level.

Loglevel to start logging at. Valid values are: 0 = Debug, 1 = Info, 2 =
Warning, 3 = Error, and 4 = Fatal. The default value is Warning.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'loglevel' => 2,
....

=== Define the syslog tag.

If you maintain different instances and aggregate the logs, you may want
to distinguish between them. `syslog_tag` can be set per instance
with a unique id. Only available if `log_type` is set to `syslog`.
The default value is `ownCloud`.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'syslog_tag' => 'ownCloud',
....

=== Define the syslog format.

The syslog format can be changed to remove or add information.
In addition to the %replacements% below %level% can be used, but it is used
as a dedicated parameter to the syslog logging facility anyway.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'log.syslog.format' => '[%reqId%][%remoteAddr%][%user%][%app%][%method%][%url%] %message%',
....

=== Define log conditions.

Log condition for log level increase based on conditions. Once one of these
conditions is met, the required log level is set to debug. This allows to
debug specific requests, users or apps

Supported conditions:
- `shared_secret`: If a request parameter with the name `log_secret` is set to
                    this value the condition is met
- `users`:         If the current request is done by one of the specified users,
                    this condition is met
- `apps`:          If the log message is invoked by one of the specified apps,
                    this condition is met
- `logfile`:       The log message invoked by the specified apps get redirected to
                this logfile, this condition is met
                Note: Not applicable when using syslog.

Defaults to an empty array.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'log.conditions' => [
	[
		'shared_secret' => '57b58edb6637fe3059b3595cf9c41b9',
		'users' => ['user1'],
		'apps' => ['files_texteditor'],
		'logfile' => '/tmp/test.log'
	],
	[
		'shared_secret' => '57b58edb6637fe3059b3595cf9c41b9',
		'users' => ['user1'],
		'apps' => ['files_mediaviewer'],
		'logfile' => '/tmp/mediaviewer.log'
	],
  ],
....

=== Define the log date format.

This uses PHP.date formatting; see http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'logdateformat' => 'F d, Y H:i:s',
....

=== Define the log timezone.

The default timezone for logfiles is UTC. You may change this; see
http://php.net/manual/en/timezones.php

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'logtimezone' => 'Europe/Berlin',
....

=== Define logging if cron ran successfully.

Log successful cron runs.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'cron_log' => true,
....

=== Define the log rotations size.

Enables log rotation and limits the total size of the logfiles.
The default is 0 or false which disables log rotation.
Specify a size in bytes, for example 104857600
(100 megabytes = 100 * 1024 * 1024 bytes).
A new logfile is created with a new name when the old logfile reaches the defined limit.
If a rotated log file is already present, it will be overwritten.
If enabled, only the active log file and one rotated file are stored.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'log_rotate_size' => false,
....

== Alternate Code Locations

Some of the ownCloud code may be stored in alternate locations.

=== Define alternative app directories.

If you want to store apps in a custom directory instead of ownCloud’s default
`/apps`, you need to modify the `apps_paths` key. There, you need to add a
new associative array that contains three elements. These are:

- `path`      The absolute file system path to the custom app folder.
- `url`       The request path to that folder relative to the ownCloud web root, prefixed with /.
- `writable`  Whether users can install apps in that folder. After the configuration is added,
              new apps will only install in a directory where writable is set to true.

The configuration example shows how to add a second directory, called `/apps-external`.
Here, new apps and updates are only written to the `/apps-external` directory.
This eases upgrade procedures of owncloud where shipped apps are delivered to apps/ by default.
`OC::$SERVERROOT` points to the web root of your instance.
Please see the Apps Management description on how to move custom apps properly.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'apps_paths' => [
	0 =>
		[
			'path' => OC::$SERVERROOT.'/apps',
			'url' => '/apps',
			'writable' => false,
		],
	1 =>
		[
			'path' => OC::$SERVERROOT.'/apps-external',
			'url' => '/apps-external',
			'writable' => true,
		],
  ],
....

== Previews

ownCloud supports previews of image files, the covers of MP3 files, and text files.
These options control enabling and disabling previews, and thumbnail size.

=== Enable preview generation.

By default, ownCloud can generate previews for the following filetypes:

- Image files
- Covers of MP3 files
- Text documents

Valid values are `true`, to enable previews, or `false`, to disable previews

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'enable_previews' => true,
....

=== Define the preview path.

Location of the thumbnails folder, defaults to `data/$user/thumbnails` where
`$user` is the current user. When specified, the format will change to
`$previews_path/$user` where `$previews_path` is the configured previews base directory
and `$user` will be substituted with the user id automatically.

For example if `previews_path` is `/var/cache/owncloud/thumbnails` then for a logged in
user `user1` the thumbnail path will be `/var/cache/owncloud/thumbnails/user1`.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'previews_path' => '',
....

=== Define the maximum x width for previews.

The maximum width, in pixels, of a preview.
A value of `null` means there is no limit.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'preview_max_x' => 2048,
....

=== Define the maximum y width for previews.

The maximum height, in pixels, of a preview. A value of `null` means there is no limit.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'preview_max_y' => 2048,
....

=== Define the maximum preview scale factor.

If a lot of small pictures are stored on the ownCloud instance and the
preview system generates blurry previews, you might want to consider setting
a maximum scale factor. By default, pictures are upscaled to 10 times the
original size. A value of `1` or `null` disables scaling.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'preview_max_scale_factor' => 10,
....

=== Define the maximum preview filesize limit.

Max file size for generating image previews with imagegd (default behaviour)
If the image is bigger, it will try other preview generators,
but will most likely show the default mimetype icon

Value represents the maximum filesize in megabytes
Default is 50. Set to -1 for no limit.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'preview_max_filesize_image' => 50,
....

=== Define the custom path for the LibreOffice/OpenOffice binary.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'preview_libreoffice_path' => '/usr/bin/libreoffice',
....

=== Define additional arguments for LibreOffice/OpenOffice.

Use this setting if LibreOffice/OpenOffice requires additional arguments.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'preview_office_cl_parameters' =>
	'--headless --nologo --nofirststartwizard --invisible --norestore ',
	'--convert-to pdf --outdir ',
....

=== Define preview providers.

Only register providers that have been explicitly enabled

The following providers are enabled by default:

- OC\Preview\PNG
- OC\Preview\JPEG
- OC\Preview\GIF
- OC\Preview\BMP
- OC\Preview\XBitmap
- OC\Preview\MarkDown

	'OC\Preview\XBitmap',
	'OC\Preview\MP3',
	'OC\Preview\TXT',
	'OC\Preview\MarkDown'
  ],
....

== Comments

Global settings for the Comments infrastructure

=== Define an alternative Comments Manager.

Replaces the default Comments Manager Factory. This can be utilized if an
own or 3rdParty CommentsManager should be used that – for instance – uses the
filesystem instead of the database to keep the comments.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'comments.managerFactory' => '\OC\Comments\ManagerFactory',
....

=== Define an alternative System Tags Manager
Replaces the default System Tags Manager Factory. This can be utilized if an
own or 3rdParty SystemTagsManager should be used that – for instance – uses the
filesystem instead of the database to keep the tags.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'systemtags.managerFactory' => '\OC\SystemTag\ManagerFactory',
....

== Maintenance

These options are for halting user activity when you are performing server
maintenance.

=== Enable maintenance mode to disable ownCloud

If you want to prevent users from logging in to ownCloud before you start
doing some maintenance work, you need to set the value of the maintenance
parameter to true. Please keep in mind that users who are already logged-in
are kicked out of ownCloud instantly.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'maintenance' => false,
....

=== Enable or disable single user mode.

When set to `true`, the ownCloud instance will be unavailable for all users
who are not in the `admin` group.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'singleuser' => false,
....

== SSL

=== Extra SSL options to be used for configuration.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'openssl' => [
	'config' => '/absolute/location/of/openssl.cnf',
  ],
....

=== Allow the configuration of system wide trusted certificates.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'enable_certificate_management' => false,
....

== Memory caching backend configuration.

Available cache backends:

* `\OC\Memcache\APCu`       APC user backend
* `\OC\Memcache\ArrayCache` In-memory array-based backend (not recommended)
* `\OC\Memcache\Memcached`  Memcached backend
* `\OC\Memcache\Redis`      Redis backend

Advice on choosing between the various backends:

* APCu should be easiest to install. Almost all distributions have packages.
  Use this for single user environment for all caches.
* Use Redis or Memcached for distributed environments.
  For the local cache (you can configure two) take APCu.

=== Memory caching backend for locally stored data.

* Used for host-specific data, e.g. file paths

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'memcache.local' => '\OC\Memcache\APCu',
....

=== Memory caching backend for distributed data.

* Used for installation-specific data, e.g. database caching
* If unset, defaults to the value of memcache.local

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'memcache.distributed' => '\OC\Memcache\Memcached',
....

=== Define redis connection details.

Connection details for redis to use for memory caching in a single server configuration.

For enhanced security it is recommended to configure Redis to require a password.
See http://redis.io/topics/security for more information.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'redis' => [
	'host' => 'localhost', // can also be a unix domain socket: '/tmp/redis.sock'
	'port' => 6379,
	'timeout' => 0.0,
	'password' => '', // Optional, if not defined no password will be used.
	'dbindex' => 0,   // Optional, if undefined SELECT will not run and will use Redis Server's default DB Index.
  ],
....

=== Connection details for a Redis Cluster.

Only for use with Redis Clustering, for Sentinel-based setups use the single
server configuration above, and perform HA on the hostname.

Redis Cluster support requires the php module phpredis in version 3.0.0 or higher.

Available failover modes:
- \RedisCluster::FAILOVER_NONE       - only send commands to master nodes (default)
- \RedisCluster::FAILOVER_ERROR      - failover to slaves for read commands if master is unavailable
- \RedisCluster::FAILOVER_DISTRIBUTE - randomly distribute read commands across master and slaves

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'redis.cluster' => [
	'seeds' => [ // provide some/all of the cluster servers to bootstrap discovery, port required
	  'localhost:7000',
	  'localhost:7001'
	],
	'timeout' => 0.0,
	'read_timeout' => 0.0,
	'failover_mode' => \RedisCluster::FAILOVER_DISTRIBUTE
  ],
....

=== Server details for one or more memcached servers to use for memory caching.

==== Code Sample

....
'memcached_options' => [
	// Set timeouts to 50ms
	\Memcached::OPT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT => 50,
	\Memcached::OPT_RETRY_TIMEOUT =>   50,
	\Memcached::OPT_SEND_TIMEOUT =>    50,
	\Memcached::OPT_RECV_TIMEOUT =>    50,
	\Memcached::OPT_POLL_TIMEOUT =>    50,

	// Enable compression
	\Memcached::OPT_COMPRESSION =>          true,

	// Turn on consistent hashing
	\Memcached::OPT_LIBKETAMA_COMPATIBLE => true,

	// Enable Binary Protocol
	\Memcached::OPT_BINARY_PROTOCOL =>      true,

	// Binary serializer will be enabled if the igbinary PECL module is available
	//\Memcached::OPT_SERIALIZER => \Memcached::SERIALIZER_IGBINARY,
  ],
....

=== Define the location of the cache folder.

The location of the cache folder defaults to `data/$user/cache` where
`$user` is the current user. When specified, the format will change to
`$cache_path/$user` where `$cache_path` is the configured cache directory
and `$user` is the user.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'cache_path' => '',
....

=== Define the TTL for garbage collection.

TTL of chunks located in the cache folder before they're removed by
garbage collection (in seconds). Increase this value if users have
issues uploading very large files via the ownCloud Client as upload isn't
completed within one day.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'cache_chunk_gc_ttl' => 86400, // 60*60*24 = 1 day
....

=== Define the DAV chunk base directory.

Location of the chunk folder, defaults to `data/$user/uploads` where
`$user` is the current user. When specified, the format will change to
`$dav.chunk_base_dir/$user` where `$dav.chunk_base_dir` is the configured
cache directory and `$user` is the user.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'dav.chunk_base_dir' => '',
....

== Using Object Store with ownCloud

== Sharing

Global settings for Sharing

=== Define an alternative Share Provider.

Replaces the default Share Provider Factory. This can be utilized if
own or 3rdParty Share Providers are used that – for instance – use the
filesystem instead of the database to keep the share information.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'sharing.managerFactory' => '\OC\Share20\ProviderFactory',
....

=== Allow schema fallback for federated sharing servers.

When talking with federated sharing server, allow falling back to HTTP
instead of hard forcing HTTPS

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'sharing.federation.allowHttpFallback' => false,
....

== All other configuration options

=== Define additional database driver options.

Additional driver options for the database connection, eg. to enable SSL
encryption in MySQL or specify a custom wait timeout on a cheap hoster.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'dbdriveroptions' => [
	PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_SSL_CA => '/file/path/to/ca_cert.pem',
	PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_INIT_COMMAND => 'SET wait_timeout = 28800'
  ],
....

=== Define sqlite3 journal mode.

sqlite3 journal mode can be specified using this configuration parameter -
can be 'WAL' or 'DELETE' see for more details https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'sqlite.journal_mode' => 'DELETE',
....

=== Define MySql 3/4 byte character handling.

During setup, if requirements are met (see below), this setting is set to true
and MySQL can handle 4 byte characters instead of 3 byte characters.

If you want to convert an existing 3-byte setup into a 4-byte setup please
set the parameters in MySQL as mentioned below and run the migration command:
`sudo -u www-data php occ db:convert-mysql-charset`
The config setting will be set automatically after a successful run.

Consult the documentation for more details.

MySQL requires a special setup for longer indexes (> 767 bytes) which are needed:

[source,console]
....
[mysqld]
innodb_large_prefix=ON
innodb_file_format=Barracuda
innodb_file_per_table=ON
....

Tables will be created with
 * character set: utf8mb4
 * collation:     utf8mb4_bin
 * row_format:    compressed

See:
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/charset-unicode-utf8mb4.html
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_large_prefix

http://mechanics.flite.com/blog/2014/07/29/using-innodb-large-prefix-to-avoid-error-1071/

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'mysql.utf8mb4' => false,
....

=== Define supported database types.

Database types that are supported for installation.

Available:
- sqlite (SQLite3 - Not in Enterprise Edition)
- mysql (MySQL)
- pgsql (PostgreSQL)
- oci (Oracle - Enterprise Edition Only)

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'supportedDatabases' => [
	'sqlite',
	'mysql',
	'pgsql',
	'oci',
  ],
....

=== Define the location for temporary files.

Override where ownCloud stores temporary files. Useful in situations where
the system temporary directory is on a limited space ramdisk or is otherwise
restricted, or if external storages which do not support streaming are in use.

The Web server user must have write access to this directory.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'tempdirectory' => '/tmp/owncloudtemp',
....

=== Define the hashing cost.

The hashing cost used by hashes generated by ownCloud.
Using a higher value requires more time and CPU power to calculate the hashes.
As this number grows, the amount of work (typically CPU time or memory) necessary
to compute the hash increases exponentially.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'hashingCost' => 10,
....

=== Define blacklisted files.

Blacklist a specific file or files and disallow the upload of files
with this name. `.htaccess` is blocked by default.

WARNING: USE THIS ONLY IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'blacklisted_files' => [
	'.htaccess'
  ],
....

=== Define excluded files.

Exclude specific directory names and disallow scanning, creating and renaming
using these names. Case insensitive.
Excluded directory names are queried at any path part like at the beginning,
in the middle or at the end and will not be further processed if found.
Please see the documentation for details and examples.
Use when the storage backend supports eg snapshot directories to be excluded.

WARNING: USE THIS ONLY IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'excluded_directories' => [
	'.snapshot',
	'~snapshot',
  ],
....

=== Define excluded files from integrity checking.

Exclude files from the integrity checker command

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'integrity.excluded.files' => [
	'.DS_Store',
	'Thumbs.db',
	'.directory',
	'.webapp',
	'.htaccess',
	'.user.ini',
  ],
....

=== Define excluded apps or themes from integrity checking.

The list of apps that are allowed to have no signature.json. Besides
ownCloud apps, this is particularly useful when creating ownCloud themes,
because themes are treated as apps. The app is identified with it´s app-id.
The following example allows app-1 and theme-2 to have no signature.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'integrity.ignore.missing.app.signature' => [
	'app-id of app-1',
	'app-id of theme-2',
  ],
....

=== Define a default folder for shared files and folders other than root.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'share_folder' => '/',
....

=== The default cipher for encrypting files.

Currently AES-128-CFB and AES-256-CFB are supported.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'cipher' => 'AES-256-CFB',
....

=== Define the minimum supported ownCloud desktop client version.

The minimum ownCloud desktop client version that will be allowed to sync with
this server instance. All connections made from earlier clients will be denied
by the server. Defaults to the minimum officially supported ownCloud version at
the time of release of this server version.

When changing this, note that older unsupported versions of the ownCloud desktop
client may not function as expected, and could lead to permanent data loss for
clients or other unexpected results.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'minimum.supported.desktop.version' => '2.3.3',
....

=== Define whether to include external storage in quota calculation.

EXPERIMENTAL: option whether to include external storage in quota
calculation, defaults to false.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'quota_include_external_storage' => false,
....

=== Define how often filesystem changes are detected.

Specifies how often the local filesystem (the ownCloud data/ directory, and
NFS mounts in data/) is checked for changes made outside ownCloud. This
does not apply to external storages.

-> Never check the filesystem for outside changes, provides a performance
increase when it's certain that no changes are made directly to the
filesystem

-> Check each file or folder at most once per request, recommended for
general use if outside changes might happen.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'filesystem_check_changes' => 0,
....

=== Define where part files are located.

By default ownCloud will store the part files created during upload in the
same storage as the upload target. Setting this to false will store the part
files in the root of the users folder which might be required to work with certain
external storage setups that have limited rename capabilities.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'part_file_in_storage' => true,
....

=== Define the location of `mount.json`.

Defaults to `data/mount.json` in the ownCloud directory.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'mount_file' => '/var/www/owncloud/data/mount.json',
....

=== Prevent cache changes due to changes in the filesystem.

When `true`, prevent ownCloud from changing the cache due to changes in the
filesystem for all storage.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'filesystem_cache_readonly' => false,
....

=== Define ownClouds internal secret.

Secret used by ownCloud for various purposes, e.g. to encrypt data.
If you lose this string there will be data corruption.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'secret' => '',
....

=== List of trusted proxy servers.

If you configure these also consider setting `forwarded_for_headers` which
otherwise defaults to `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` (the `X-Forwarded-For` header).

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'trusted_proxies' => [
	'203.0.113.45',
	'198.51.100.128'
  ],
....

=== Define `forwarded_for_headers`.

Headers that should be trusted as client IP address in combination with
`trusted_proxies`. If the HTTP header looks like 'X-Forwarded-For', then use
'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR' here.

If set incorrectly, a client can spoof their IP address as visible to
ownCloud, bypassing access controls and making logs useless!

If not set, defaults to 'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'forwarded_for_headers' => [
	'HTTP_X_FORWARDED',
	'HTTP_FORWARDED_FOR'
  ],
....

=== Defines the maximum filesize for animated GIF´s.

Max file size for animating gifs on public-sharing-site.
If the gif is bigger, it'll show a static preview.

Value represents the maximum filesize in megabytes.
Default is `10`. Set to `-1` for no limit.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'max_filesize_animated_gifs_public_sharing' => 10,
....

=== Enables transactional file locking.

Transactional file locking is enabled by default.

Prevents concurrent processes from accessing the same files
at the same time. Can help prevent side effects that would
be caused by concurrent operations. Mainly relevant for
very large installations with many users working with shared files.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'filelocking.enabled' => true,
....

=== Defines the TTL for file locking.

Set the lock's time-to-live in seconds.

Any lock older than this will be automatically cleaned up.
If not set this defaults to either 1 hour or the php max_execution_time, whichever is higher.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'filelocking.ttl' => 3600,
....

=== Memory caching backend for file locking.

Because most memcache backends can clean values without warning,
using redis is highly recommended to *avoid data loss*.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'memcache.locking' => '\\OC\\Memcache\\Redis',
....

=== Disable or disable the web based updater.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'upgrade.disable-web' => false,
....

=== Defines the automatic update of market apps.

Set to `false` to disable.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'upgrade.automatic-app-update' => true,
....

=== Set this ownCloud instance into debugging mode.

Only enable this for local development and not in production environments
This will disable the minifier and outputs some additional debug information

WARNING:
   Be warned that, if you set this to `true`, exceptions display
   stack traces on the web interface, *including passwords*, — **in plain text!**.
   We strongly encourage you never to use it in production.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'debug' => false,
....

=== Set the data-fingerprint of the current data served.

This is a property used by the clients to find out if a backup has been
restored on the server. Once a backup is restored run
{occ-command-example-prefix} maintenance:data-fingerprint
To set this to a new value.

Updating/Deleting this value can make connected clients stall until
the user has resolved conflicts.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'data-fingerprint' => '',
....

=== Define if you have copied the sample configuration.

This entry is just here to show a warning in case somebody copied the sample configuration.
WARNING: DO NOT ADD THIS SWITCH TO YOUR CONFIGURATION!

If you, brave person, have read until here be aware that you should not
modify *ANY* settings in this file without reading the documentation.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'copied_sample_config' => true,
....

=== Enable or disable the files_external local mount option.

Set this property to true if you want to enable the files_external local mount option.
Default: `false`

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'files_external_allow_create_new_local' => false,
....

=== Enable or disbale debug logging for SMB access.

Set this property to true if you want to enable debug logging for SMB access.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'smb.logging.enable' => false,
....

=== Enable or disable async DAV extensions.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'dav.enable.async' => false,
....

=== Enable or disbale tech previews.

Tech preview extensions are disabled by default.

==== Code Sample

[source,php]
....
'dav.enable.tech_preview' => false,
....
