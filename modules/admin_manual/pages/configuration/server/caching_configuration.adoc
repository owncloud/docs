== Introduction

You can _significantly_ improve ownCloud server performance by using memory caching. This is the process of storing frequently requested objects in memory for faster retrieval later. There are two types of memory caching available:

A PHP opcode Cache (OPcache)::
An opcode cache stores compiled PHP scripts (opcodes) so they don’t need to be parsed and compiled every time they are called. These compiled PHP scripts are stored in shared memory on the server on which they’re compiled.

A Data Cache::
A data cache stores copies of _data_, _templates_, and other types of _information-based files_. Depending on the cache implementation, it can be either _local_ or specific to one server or _distributed_ across multiple servers. This cache type is ideal when you have a scale-out installation.

In addition, we suggest to use *External Transactional File Locking* which reduces load on the database significantly.

== Supported Caching Backends

The caching backends supported by ownCloud are:

* xref:opcache[Opcache] +
  This is an opcode cache only and does *not* cache any data.
  Opcache is bundled with PHP from version 5.5.0 and later.
* xref:apcu[APCu] +
  This is a data cache only and does *not* cache any opcode.
  APCu 4.0.6 and up is required.
* xref:redis[Redis] +
  This is an in-memory data structure store (cache) for single and multi-server ownCloud installations, which provides file locking and can be set up in local or distributed environments. Consider Redis younger, richer in features and more configurable than memcached. At least version 2.2.6 or higher of the PHP Redis extension is required.
* xref:memcached[Memcached] +
  This is a distributed cache for multi-server ownCloud installations and has *no* file locking capabilities.

See the following page to learn more about the {redis-memcached-url}[Redis vs. Memcached – 2021 Comparison].

[NOTE]
====
You may use _both_ a local and a distributed cache. The recommended ownCloud caches are APCu and Redis. If you do not install and enable a local memory cache you will see a warning on your ownCloud admin page. If you enable only a distributed cache in your `config.php` (`memcache.distributed`) and not a local cache (`memcache.local`) you will still see the cache warning.
====

=== Cache Directory Location

The cache directory defaults to `data/$user/cache` where `$user` is the current user. You may use the `'cache_path'` directive in your configuration for different locations. For details see the  xref:configuration/server/config_sample_php_parameters.adoc#define-the-location-of-the-cache-folder[Define the location of the cache folder] description.

== Cache Types

=== Opcache

Opcache should be enabled by default in your php installation. To check it, run the following command:

[source,php]
----
php -r 'phpinfo();' | grep opcache.enable
----

=== APCu

The easiest cache to use is APCu, because it is a data cache, very fast and nothing needs to be configured. APCu can not be used when needed to run on an external server.

==== Installing APCu

[source,console]
----
# On Ubuntu/Debian/Mint systems
sudo apt install php-apcu
----

With that done, assuming that you don’t encounter any errors, restart Apache and the extension is ready to use.

=== Redis

{redis_url}[Redis] is an excellent modern memory cache to use for both distributed caching and as a local cache for
xref:configuration/files/files_locking_transactional.adoc[transactional file locking], because it guarantees that cached objects are available for as long as they are needed.

The performance of Redis when used with a socket connection is close to the performance of APCu.

NOTE: The Redis PHP module must be at least version 2.2.6 or higher.

NOTE: The default shipped Redis version and the php-redis extension for Ubuntu 20.04 is 5.x. With Redis version 6, a new authentication mechanism has been introduced named ACL (Access Control Lists). ownCloud does not currently support Redis ACL´s, but does support the password protection available with current Redis versions.

==== Installing Redis

If you have Ubuntu 16.04 or higher:

[source,console]
----
sudo apt install redis-server php-redis
----

The installer will automatically launch Redis and configure it to launch at startup.

After that, assuming that you don’t encounter any errors, restart Apache and the extension is ready to use.

==== Additional notes for Redis vs. APCu on Memory Caching

APCu is faster at local caching than Redis. If you have enough memory, use APCu for memory caching and Redis for file locking. If you are low on memory, use Redis for both.


==== Clearing the Redis Cache

The Redis cache can be flushed from the command-line using the {rediscli_url}[redis-cli tool], as in the following example:

----
sudo redis-cli
SELECT <dbIndex>
FLUSHDB
----

`<dbIndex>` is the number of the Redis database where the cache is stored. It is zero by default at ownCloud. To check what yours is currently set to for ownCloud, check the `dbindex` value in `config/config.php`. To change it, see the
xref:configuration/server/config_sample_php_parameters.adoc#memory-caching-backend-configuration[Memory caching backend configuration]

NOTE: Out of the box, every Redis instance supports 16 databases so `<dbIndex>` has to be set between 0 and 15.

Please read more about the instructions for the
{redis_select_url}[select] and {redis_flushdb_url}[flushdb] command.

=== Memcached

Memcached is a reliable old-timer for shared caching on distributed servers. It performs well with ownCloud with one exception: it is not suitable to use with
xref:configuration/files/files_locking_transactional.adoc[Transactional File Locking].
This is because it does not store locks, and data can disappear from the cache at any time. Given that, Redis is the best memory cache to use.

NOTE: Be sure to install the *memcached* PHP module, and not _memcache_, as in the following examples. ownCloud supports only the *memcached* PHP module.

==== Installing Memcached

===== On Ubuntu/Debian/Mint

On Ubuntu/Debian/Mint run the following command:

[source,console]
----
sudo apt-get install memcached php-memcached
----

NOTE: The installer will automatically start `memcached` and configure it to launch at startup.

==== Configuration File Paths

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
| PHP Version | Filename
| {minimum-php-printed} | `/etc/php/{minimum-php-version}/mods-available/memcached.ini`
|===

After that, assuming that you don’t encounter any errors:

. Restart your Web server
. Add the appropriate entries to `config.php` (which you can find an example of below)
. Refresh your ownCloud admin page

==== Clearing the Memcached Cache

The Memcached cache can be flushed from the command line, using a range of common Linux/Unix tools including `netcat` and `telnet`. The following example uses telnet to log in, run the {flushall_url}[flush_all command], and log out:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
telnet localhost {std-port-memcache}
flush_all
quit
----

== Configuring Memory Caching

Memory caches must be explicitly configured in ownCloud by:

. Installing and enabling your desired cache (whether that be the PHP extension and/or the caching server).
. Adding the appropriate entry to ownCloud’s `config.php`.

See the
xref:configuration/server/config_sample_php_parameters.adoc#memory-caching-backend-configuration[Memory caching backend configuration]
for an overview of all possible config parameters, as the examples below only show basic configuration settings. After installing and enabling your chosen memory cache, verify that it is active by viewing the
xref:configuration/general_topics/general_troubleshooting.adoc#php-version-and-information[PHP configuration details].

=== Opcache Configuration

Opcache should already be configured with PHP 7, see the {php-net-url}/manual/en/opcache.installation.php[opcache documentation] for details.

=== APCu Configuration

To use APCu, add this line to `config.php`:

[source,php]
----
'memcache.local' => '\OC\Memcache\APCu',
----

With that done, refresh your ownCloud admin page, and the cache warning should disappear.

=== Redis Configuration

Redis is very configurable; consult {redis_doc_url}[the Redis documentation] to learn more.

Regardless of whether you have setup Redis to use TCP or a Unix socket, we recommend adding the following for best performance. This enables External Transactional File Locking based on Redis:

[source,php]
----
'filelocking.enabled' => true,
'memcache.locking' => '\OC\Memcache\Redis',
----

==== Redis Configuration Using TCP

The following example `config.php` configuration connects to a Redis cache via TCP:

// do not shrink the blanks on port because of proper alignment in rendering
[source,php,subs="attributes+"]
----
'memcache.local' => '\OC\Memcache\Redis',
'redis' => [
    'host' => 'localhost',       // For a Unix domain socket, use '/var/run/redis/redis.sock'
    'port' => {std-port-redis},  // Set to 0 when using a Unix socket
    'timeout' => 0,              // Optional, keep connection open forever
    'password' => '',            // Optional, if not defined no password will be used.
    'dbindex' => 0,              // Optional, if undefined SELECT will not run and will
                                 // use Redis Server's default DB Index.
],
----

==== Redis Configuration Using Unix Sockets

If Redis is running on the same server as ownCloud, it is recommended to configure it to use Unix sockets. Then, configure ownCloud to communicate with Redis as in the following example. 

[source,php]
----
# Change the host value, based on the socket's location in your distribution
'memcache.local' => '\OC\Memcache\Redis',
'redis' => [
    'host' => '/var/run/redis/redis.sock',
    'port' => 0,
    'password' => '',            // Optional, if not defined no password will be used.
    'dbindex' => 0,              // Optional, if undefined SELECT will not run and will
                                 // use Redis Server's default DB Index.
],
----

If setting up Redis to be accessed via a Unix socket from a webserver user, then consider the following:

. Make the webserver user `www-data` member of the group `redis` in `/etc/group`, e.g.,
  `redis:x:110:www-data`
. In your Redis configuration (`/etc/redis/redis.conf`) set `unixsocketperm` to `770`

To see a benchmark comparison, run:

[source,console]
----
sudo redis-benchmark -q -n 100000
sudo redis-benchmark -s /var/run/redis/redis-server.sock -q -n 100000
----

In the following table, you will see an example gain of about +20% when using sockets compared
to TCP on localhost. The values can differ in your environment. Please do a local check.

=== Memcached Configuration
This example uses APCu for the local cache, Memcached as the distributed memory cache, and lists all the servers in the shared cache pool with their port numbers:

[source,php,subs="attributes+"]
----
'memcache.local' => '\OC\Memcache\APCu',
'memcache.distributed' => '\OC\Memcache\Memcached',
'memcached_servers' => [
     ['localhost', {std-port-memcache}],
     ['server1.example.com', {std-port-memcache}],
     ['server2.example.com', {std-port-memcache}],
 ],
----

=== Configuration Recommendations Based on Type of Deployment

==== Small/Private Home Server

[source,php]
----
// Only use APCu
'memcache.local' => '\OC\Memcache\APCu',
----

==== Small Organization, Single-server Setup

Use APCu for local caching, Redis for file locking

[source,php,subs="attributes+"]
----
'memcache.local' => '\OC\Memcache\APCu',
'memcache.locking' => '\OC\Memcache\Redis',
'redis' => [
    'host' => 'localhost',
    'port' => {std-port-redis},
],
----

==== Large Organization, Clustered Setup

Use Redis for everything except a local memory cache. Use the server’s IP address or hostname so that it is accessible to other hosts:

[source,php,subs="attributes+"]
----
'memcache.distributed' => '\OC\Memcache\Redis',
'memcache.locking' => '\OC\Memcache\Redis',
'memcache.local' => '\OC\Memcache\APCu',
'redis' => [
    'host' => 'server1',      // hostname example
    'host' => '12.34.56.78',  // IP address example
    'port' => {std-port-redis},
],
----

== Configure Transactional File Locking

xref:configuration/files/files_locking_transactional.adoc[Transactional File Locking]
prevents simultaneous file saving. It is enabled by default and uses the database to store the locking data. This places a significant load on your database. It is recommended to use a cache backend instead. You have to configure it in `config.php` as in the following example, which uses Redis as the cache backend:

[source,php,subs="attributes+"]
----
'filelocking.enabled' => true,
'memcache.locking' => '\OC\Memcache\Redis',
'redis' => [
     'host' => 'localhost',
     'port' => {std-port-redis},
     'timeout' => 0,
     'password' => '',     // Optional, if not defined no password will be used.
 ],
----

CAUTION: For enhanced security, it is recommended to configure Redis to require a password. See {redis_security_url} for more information.

== Caching Exceptions

If ownCloud is configured to use either Memcached or Redis as a memory cache, you may encounter issues with functionality. When these occur, it is usually a result of PHP being incorrectly configured or the relevant PHP extension not being available.

In the table below, you can see all of the known reasons for reduced or broken functionality related to caching.

[width="100%",cols="41%,59%",options="header",]
|===
| Setup/Configuration                              | Result
| If file locking is enabled, but the locking cache class is missing,
then an exception will appear in the web UI        | The application will not be usable
| If file locking is enabled and the locking cache is configured, but the
PHP module missing.                                | There will be a white page/exception in web UI. It
will be a full page issue, and the application will not be usable
| All enabled, but the Redis server is not running | The application will
be usable. But any file operation will return a "500 Redis went away" exception
| If Memcache is configured for `local` and `distributed`, but the
class is missing                                   | There will be a white page and an exception written to
the logs, This is because autoloading needs the missing class. So there is no way to show a page
|===
