= Importing System-wide and Personal SSL Certificates
:toc: right
:experimental:

== Introduction

Modern Web browsers try to keep us safe, and so they blast us with scary
warnings when sites have the smallest errors in their SSL certificates,
or when they use self-signed SSL certificates. ownCloud admins encounter
this when creating Federation shares, or setting up external storage
mounts. There is no reason against using self-signed certificates on
your own networks; they’re fast, free, and easy.

== Importing Personal SSL Certificates

ownCloud has several methods for importing self-signed certificates so
that you don’t have to hassle with Web browser warnings. When you allow
your users to create their own external storage mounts or Federation
shares, they can import SSL certificates for those shares on their
Personal pages.

Click the *Import root certificate* button to open a file picker. You
can distribute copies of your SSL certificates to your users (via an
ownCloud share!), or users can download them from their Web browsers.
Click on the little padlock icon and click through until you see a btn:[View
Certificate] button, then keep going until you can download it. In
Firefox and Chromium there is an btn:[Export] button for downloading your
own copy of a site’s SSL certificate.

[[site-wide-ssl-import]]
== Site-wide SSL Import

The personal imports only work for individual users.
You can enable site-wide SSL certificates for all of your users on your ownCloud admin page.
To enable this, you must add this line to your `config.php` file:

[source,php]
....
'enable_certificate_management' => true,
....

Then you’ll have an btn:[Import root certificate] button on your admin page,
just like the one on your personal page.
Navigate to it by clicking menu:Settings[General > SSL Root Certificates] which is located almost at the bottom.

== Using OCC to Import and Manage SSL Certificates

The `occ` command has options for listing and managing your SSL certificates:

....
security:certificates         list trusted certificates
security:certificates:import  import trusted certificate
security:certificates:remove  remove trusted certificate
....

See xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc[Using the occ Command] to learn about how to use `occ`.
