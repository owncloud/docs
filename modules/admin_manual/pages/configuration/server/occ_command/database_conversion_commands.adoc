= Database Conversion

The SQLite database is good for testing, and for ownCloud servers with small single-user workloads that do not use sync clients, but production servers with multiple users should use MariaDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL.
You can use `occ` to convert from SQLite to one of these other databases.

[source,console]
----
db
 db:convert-type           Convert the ownCloud database to the newly configured one
----

You need:

* Your desired database and its PHP connector installed.
* The login and password of a database admin user.
* The database port number, if it is a non-standard port.

This is example converts SQLite to MySQL/MariaDB:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} db:convert-type mysql oc_dbuser 127.0.0.1 oc_database
----
