== Enable an App

Enable an app, for example the Market app.

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} app:enable market
market enabled
----

== Disable an App

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} app:disable market
market disabled
----

NOTE: Be aware that the following apps cannot be disabled: _DAV_, _FederatedFileSharing_, _Files_ and _Files_External_.

`app:check-code` has multiple checks: it checks if an app uses ownCloud's public API (`OCP`) or private API (`OC_`), and it also checks for deprecated methods and the validity of the `info.xml` file. 
By default all checks are enabled. 
The Activity app is an example of a correctly-formatted app.
