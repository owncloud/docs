== Introduction

When sharing files, security is a key aspect. The ownCloud {oc-marketplace-url}/apps/files_antivirus[Anti-Virus] extension helps by protecting against malicious software like trojans or viruses. It forwards files that are being uploaded to the ownCloud server to a  malware scanning engine before they are written to the storage. When a file is recognized as malicious, it can be logged and prevented from being uploaded to the server to ensure that files in ownCloud are free of malware. More sophisticated rules may be specified as admin in the ownCloud Webinterface menu:Admin[Settings > Security].

Out of the box, the ownCloud Anti-Virus extension works with {clamav-url}[Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV)] as the directly supported virus scanner. It detects all forms of malware including trojans, viruses and worms and scans compressed files, executables, image files, PDF, as well as many other file types. The ownCloud Anti-Virus application relies on the underlying ClamAV virus scanning engine, to which the admin points ownCloud when configuring the application. The ClamAV virus definitions need to be kept up to date in order to provide effective protection.

Starting with Anti-Virus version 1.0.0, the app also offers an ICAP integration for Enterprise installations. Admins can integrate their favorite enterprise-grade antivirus scanners through the open standard {icap-url}[Internet Content Adaptation Protocol (ICAP)]. With this set up, ownCloud can delegate the scanning of uploaded files to another machine, the ICAP server. The ICAP server then checks them and either greenlights them or, if malicious code is found, treats the offending file(s) as specified in the settings and notifies the ownCloud server. ownCloud can then act accordingly and based on the settings made reject the upload. Offloading the anti-virus scans to another dedicated server can greatly improve performance compared to running the ClamAV virus scanner on the same machine as ownCloud.

== ClamAV

=== ClamAV Feature List

* Operates on all major operating systems, including _Windows_, _Linux_, and _macOS_.
* Detects all forms of malware including _Trojan horses_, _viruses_, and _worms_.
* Scans _compressed files_, _executables_, _image files_, _Flash_, _PDF_, as well as many others.

What's more, ClamAV's Freshclam daemon automatically updates its malware signature database at scheduled intervals.

=== ClamAV Integration Into ownCloud

ownCloud integrates with antivirus tools by connecting to them via:

* A URL
* A host name and port
* A socket
* Streaming the data from the command line via a pipe with a configured executable

In case of ClamAV, ownCloud's antivirus extension sends files either through a unix-domain socket (which requires clamd running on the same host) or through a pipe to stdin/stdout of the clamscan executable (installed on the same host) or through the network using a host name and port pair (which allows running the clamd daemon on another server).

NOTE: Individual chunks are *not* scanned. The whole file is scanned when it is moved or saved to the final location.

The information is then parsed, or an exit code is evaluated if no result is available to determine the response from the scan. In case of an infected upload, the appropriate action is always to delete the file(s). The choice "delete" or "log" for the infected condition only applies to the special case of background scans.

NOTE: Scanner exit status rules are used to handle errors when ClamAV is run in CLI mode. Scanner output rules are used in daemon/socket mode only.

=== Scanning Notes for ClamAV

. Files are checked when they are uploaded or updated but _not_ when they are downloaded.
. ownCloud does not maintain a cache of previously scanned files.
. If the app is either not configured or is misconfigured, then it rejects file uploads.
. If ClamAV is unavailable, then the app rejects file uploads.
. A file size limit applies both to background scans and to file uploads.
. After installing ClamAV and the related tools, you will have two configuration files: `/etc/freshclam.conf` and `/etc/clamd.d/scan.conf`.
. We recommend that you enable verbose logging in both `clamd.conf` and `freshclam.conf` initially, to verify correct operation of both.

=== Installing ClamAV

Install ClamAV on Ubuntu with the following command:

[source,console]
----
sudo apt install clamav clamav-daemon
----

This automatically creates the default configuration files and launches the `clamd` and `freshclam` daemons.


==== Enabling and Running ClamAV

Enable and start the `clamd` service with following commands.

[source,console]
----
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable clamav-daemon.service
sudo systemctl start clamav-daemon.service
----

When successful, an output similar to the following should appear on the terminal:

[source,console]
----
Synchronizing state of clamav-daemon.service with SysV service script with
/lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install.
Executing: /lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install enable clamav-daemon
----

==== ClamAV Virus Database Updates

. You can manually start the updating process with this command:
+
[source,console]
----
sudo freshclam
----
+
You should update manually at least once before using ClamAV within ownCloud. The initial update can take several minutes. In case of persisting issues running `freshclam`, you can gently end the process with the following command:
+
[source,console]
----
sudo pkill -15 -x freshclam
----
+
and retry manually updating again.

. To automate the update process, run this cron entry for example.
+
[source,console]
----
# m   h  dom mon dow  command
47  *  *  *  *  /usr/bin/freshclam --quiet
----
+
NOTE: Avoid any multiples of 10 to better distribute the load on the ClamAV virus pattern servers. This can reduce the load on the servers and therefore update times.

=== Install the ownCloud Anti-Virus App

The Anti-Virus app needs to be installed from the ownCloud Market (it's available in the  _"Security"_ category).

image:apps/files_antivirus/antivirus-app.png[image, width=70%]

To install the App directly via the occ command, execute:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} market:install files_antivirus
----

=== Configuring ClamAV within ownCloud

IMPORTANT: If the app is enabled but either not or incorrectly configured, it will *strictly reject all uploads* for the whole instance!

ClamAV can be configured in the following two ways:

. xref:configure-clamav-using-the-av-configuration-panel[By using the Antivirus Configuration panel]
. xref:configure-clamav-using-occ[By using the `occ config:app` command set.]

==== Change Log Level Temporarily

Once ClamAV is installed, select menu:Settings[General (Admin)] and, in the "*Log*" section, temporarily set btn:[Log level] to "_Everything (fatal issues, errors, warnings, info, debug)_".

image:apps/files_antivirus/antivirus-logging.png[The ownCloud Antivirus Configuration panel]

==== Configure ClamAV Using the AV Configuration Panel

Navigate to menu:Settings[Security (Admin)], where you'll find the "**Antivirus Configuration**" panel as you can see in the example screenshot below.

image:apps/files_antivirus/antivirus-daemon.png[The Antivirus Configuration panel in ownCloud]

==== Configure ClamAV Using occ

All of the configuration settings for ClamAV are configurable by passing the relevant key and value to the `occ config:app:set files_antivirus` command. For example:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:app:set files_antivirus \
    av_socket --value="/var/run/clamav/clamd.ctl"
----

To get a current option run for example:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:app:get files_antivirus \
    av_socket
----

[caption=]
.Available Configuration Settings
[cols="23%,45%,15%",options="header"]
|===
|Setting
|Description
|Default

|`av_cmd_options`
|Extra command line options (comma-separated) to pass to ClamAV.
|

|`av_host`
|The host name or IP address of the antivirus server.
|

|`av_infected_action`
|The action to take when infected files were found during a background scan. +
It can be set to one of `only_log` and `delete`.
|`only_log`

|`av_max_file_size`
|The maximum file size limit; +
`-1` means no limit.
|`-1`

|`av_mode`
|The Anti Virus binary operating mode. +
It can be set to one of `executable`, `daemon`, and `socket`.
|`executable`

|`av_path`
|The path to the `clamscan` executable.
|`/usr/bin/clamscan`

|`av_port`
|The port number of the antivirus server. +
Allowed values are `1 - 65535`.
|

|`av_scan_background`
|Should scans run in the background?
|`true`


|`av_socket`
|The name of ClamAV's UNIX socket file.
|`/var/run/clamav/clamd.ctl`

|`av_stream_max_length`
|The maximum stream length that ClamAV will accept in bytes (*).
|`26214400`
|===

(*) The `Stream Length` value sets the number of bytes to read in one pass and defaults to 26214400 bytes (twenty-six megabytes). This value should be no larger than the PHP `memory_limit` settings or physical memory if `memory_limit` is set to -1 (no limit).

==== Configuration Modes

ClamAV runs in one of three modes:

* xref:daemon-socket[Daemon (Socket)]
* xref:daemon[Daemon]
* xref:executable[Executable]

[TIP]
====
In both daemon modes, background scans are enabled by default. If you want to disable them, run the command:
[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:app:set files_antivirus av_scan_background --value 'false'
----
====
===== Daemon (Socket, Same Server)

In _Daemon (Socket)_ mode, ClamAV runs in the background on the same server as the ownCloud installation, or the socket can be made available via a share mount. When there is no activity, `clamd` places a minimal load on your system. Consider that high CPU usage can occur when users upload large volumes of files.

IMPORTANT: You must run `freshclam` at least once for ClamAV to generate the socket.

image:apps/files_antivirus/antivirus-daemon-socket.png[image]

. Set btn:[Mode] to "*Daemon (Socket)*". ownCloud should detect your `clamd` socket and fill in the "*Socket*" field. This is the `LocalSocket` option in `clamd.conf`.
+
You can run `ss` (a utility to investigate sockets) to verify it, as in the example below:
+
[source,console]
----
sudo ss -a | grep -iq clamav && echo "ClamAV is running"
----
+
[TIP]
====
If you don't have `ss` installed, you may have `netstat` installed. If so, you can run the following to check if ClamAV is running:
[source,console]
----
netstat -a | grep -q clam && echo "ClamAV is running"
----
====

. When infected files were found during a background scan, you have the choice of either:
+
* Logging any alerts without deleting the files
* Immediately deleting infected files

===== Daemon (Different Server)

In _Daemon_ mode, ClamAV runs on a different server. This is a good option to reduce load on the ownCloud servers when high network bandwidth is available and many concurrent uploads happen.

image:apps/files_antivirus/antivirus-daemon.png[image]

. Set btn:[Mode] to "*Daemon*".
. Set btn:[Host] to the host name or IP address of the remote server running ClamAV, and set btn:[Port] to the server's port number.
+
TIP: The port number is the value of `TCPSocket` in `/etc/clamav/clamd.conf`.

===== Executable

In _Executable_ mode, ClamAV runs on the same server as the ownCloud installation, with the `clamscan` command running only when a file is uploaded.

TIP: `clamscan` can respond slower and may not always be reliable for on-demand usage; it is better to use one of the daemon modes.

image:apps/files_antivirus/antivirus-executable.png[image, width=80%]

The image shows a command line option `--allmatch=yes` (continue scanning within the file after finding a match) which is not necessary to be set and just used here for demonstration purposes of the field.

NOTE: Starting with ownCloud Anti-Virus version 1.0.0, the path to `clamscan` and the command line options are set via a config.php entry and are read-only in the user interface. Refer to the xref:configuration/server/config_apps_sample_php_parameters.adoc[config.php parameters for apps] for more details.

NOTE: If you had configured the path and command line options before via the user interface, the values are being migrated from the database to config.php automatically. Check the settings in config.php for their presence after upgrading.

. Set btn:[Mode] to "*Executable*".
. Set btn:[Path to clamscan] to the path of `clamscan`, which is the interactive ClamAV scanning command, on your server. To find the exact path, run
+
[source,console]
----
which clamscan
----


==== Set Back Log Level

When you are satisfied with how ClamAV is operating, you might want to go back and change all of your logging to less verbose levels.

==== Configuration Warnings

The Anti-Virus App shows one of three warnings if it is misconfigured or ClamAV is not available. You can see an example of all three below.

image:configuration/server/anti-virus-message-host-connection-problem.png[Configuration error message: 'Antivirus app is misconfigured or antivirus inaccessible. Could not connect to host 'localhost' on port 999'.]

image:configuration/server/anti-virus-message-misconfiguration-problem.png[Configuration error message: 'Antivirus app is misconfigured or antivirus inaccessible. The antivirus executable could not be found at path '/usr/bin/clamsfcan''.]

image:configuration/server/anti-virus-message-socket-connection-problem.png[Configuration error message: 'Antivirus app is misconfigured or antivirus inaccessible. Could not connect to socket ´/var/run/clamav/cslamd-socket´: No such file or directory (code 2)'.]

==== Manage Infected Files Found

During an upload these actions are taken:

* The upload is blocked.
* The event is logged in the owncloud server log.
* The event is reported and/or logged by the client / Web UI.

During a background scan the app can take one of two actions:

* **Log Only**: Log the event.
* **Delete file**: Delete the detected file.

Set btn:[When infected files were found during a background scan] to the value that suits your needs.

==== Response Rule Configuration

ownCloud provides the ability to customize how it reacts to the response given by an antivirus scan.
To do so, under menu:Admin[Security (Admin)] click btn:[Advanced], which you can see in the screenshot below, you can view and change the existing rules.
You can also add new ones.

image:configuration/server/anti-virus-configuration-rules.png[image]

Rules can match on either an exit status (e.g., 0, 1, or 40) or a pattern in the string returned from ClamAV (e.g., `/.\*: (.\*) FOUND$/`).

Here are some points to bear in mind about rules:

* Scanner exit status rules are used to handle errors when ClamAV is run in CLI mode, while
* Scanner output rules are used in daemon/socket mode.
* Daemon output is parsed by regexp.
* In case there are no matching rules, the status is: `Unknown`, and a warning will be logged.

===== Default Rule Set

[caption=]
.The default rule set for ClamAV is populated automatically with the following rules:
[cols="20%,45%,15%",options="header",]
|===
| Exit Status or Signature | Description | Marks File As
| 0 | | Clean
| 1 | | Infected
| 40 | Unknown option passed | Unchecked
| 50 | Database initialization error | Unchecked
| 52 | Not supported file type | Unchecked
| 53 | Can't open directory | Unchecked
| 54 | Can't open file | Unchecked
| 55 | Error reading file | Unchecked
| 56 | Can't stat input file | Unchecked
| 57 | Can't get absolute path name of current working directory
| Unchecked
| 58 | I/O error | Unchecked
| 62 | Can't initialize logger | Unchecked
| 63 | Can't create temporary files/directories | Unchecked
| 64 | Can't write to temporary directory | Unchecked
| 70 | Can't allocate memory (calloc) | Unchecked
| 71 | Can't allocate memory (malloc) | Unchecked
| /.*: OK$/ | | Clean
| /.\*: (.*) FOUND$/ | | Infected
| /.\*: (.*) ERROR$/ | | Unchecked
|===

The rules are always checked in the following order:

. Infected
. Error
. Clean

In case there are no matching rules, the status would be `Unknown` and a warning would be logged.

===== Update an Existing Rule

. You can change the rules to either match an exit status or the scanner's output.
** To match on an exit status, change the
* "**Match by**" dropdown list to "**Scanner exit status**" and
* in the "**Scanner exit status or signature to search**" field, add the status code to match on.
** To match on the scanner's output, change the
* "**Match by**" dropdown list to "**Scanner output**" and
* in the "**Scanner exit status or signature to search**" field, add the regular expression to match against the scanner's output.

. Then, while not mandatory, add a description of what the status or scan output means. After that, set what ownCloud should do when the exit status or regular expression you set matches the value returned by ClamAV. To do so, change the value of the dropdown in the "**Mark as**" column.
+
[caption=]
.The dropdown supports the following three options:
[width="50%",cols="20%,60%",options="header",]
|===
| Option    | Description
| Clean     | The file is clean and contains no viruses
| Infected  | The file contains a virus
| Unchecked | No action should be taken
|===

With all these changes made, click the btn:[check mark] on the left-hand side of the "**Match by**" column, to confirm the change to the rule.

===== Add A New Rule

To add a new rule, click the button marked btn:[Add a rule] at the bottom left of the rules table.
Then follow the process outlined in xref:default-ruleset[Update An Existing Rule].

===== Delete An Existing Rule

To delete an existing rule, click the btn:[rubbish bin] icon on the far right-hand side of the rule that you want to delete.

== ICAP

{icap-url}[ICAP] is an open standard supported by many antivirus products. With the release of the _Anti-Virus_ app 1.0.0, other virus scanners beside ClamAV can be used via ICAP if you are running it on an ownCloud Enterprise Edition. Currently the only tested and supported virus scanners, besides ClamAV, are _Kaspersky ScanEngine_ and _McAfee Antivirus_ although far more products might simply work. The use of ICAP requires an enterprise license. The functionality can be tested without a license with a grace period of 24 hours.

=== Installation

. If you haven't done so already, install the {oc-marketplace-url}/apps/files_antivirus[Anti-Virus app] from the ownCloud marketplace. Alternatively, use this occ command:
+
[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} market:install files_antivirus
----

. Enable the app as admin in ownCloud under menu:Settings[Apps] in the category `Security` or with the following occ command:
+
[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} app:enable files_antivirus
----

=== General Configuration

ICAP can be configured via the Web interface as admin user or via
xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc[occ config:app commands].

==== Antivirus Configuration Panel

Log in to ownCloud as admin via the Web interface and go to menu:Admin[Settings > Security] and you'll see the Antivirus Configuration dialog.

image:apps/files_antivirus/antivirus-icap.png[Security Settings, width:80%]

Enter the desired values:

`Mode`::
Set to `Daemon (ICAP)`.

`Host`::
Enter the IP address of your ICAP server.

`Port`::
Specify the port number (default 1344).

`Stream Length`::
Set the length of streams sent to the ICAP server in bytes.

`File size limit`::
If you want to limit the file size, enter the maximum value in bytes. Default is no limit (-1).

`ICAP request service`::
Select the antivirus software you want to use: avscan for ClamAV, req for Kaspersky ScanEngine or `wwreqmod` for McAfee.

`ICAP response header holding the virus information`::
Use `X-Infection-Found` for ClamAV (avscan) and `X-Virus-ID` for KAV (req). McAfee doesn't offer response headers.

`When infected files were found during a background scan`::
Specify what to do with the flagged files. Possible values: `Delete file` or `Only log`.

CAUTION: Do not change the rules hidden under btn:[Advanced] unless you know exactly what you're doing. The defaults should work best. If you have special requirements, contact us at consulting@owncloud.com.

==== ICAP Configuration

You can configure the ownCloud Anti-Virus app either via the Web interface or the command line. The Web interface fields can be easily matched to the command line field names. On the command line, change into your ownCloud directory, usually `/var/www/owncloud`, and enter the following occ commands with an IP address and port based on your environment:

. Set the IP address of your anti-virus server:
+
[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:app:set files_antivirus \
    av_host --value="172.17.0.3"
----

. Specify the port of the anti-virus server:
+
[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:app:set files_antivirus \
    av_port --value="1344"
----

. Set the mode to ICAP:
+
[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:app:set files_antivirus \
    av_mode --value="icap"
----
+
NOTE: The setting `icap` triggers a grace period of 24 hours if you don't have an Enterprise license but want to test ICAP.

. Specify what to do with the offending file:
+
[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:app:set files_antivirus \
    av_infected_action --value="delete"
----
+
Possible values are `delete` and `only_log`.
+
Depending on your ICAP server, select one of the following example configurations.

=== Run with c-icap/ClamAV

`c-icap` can be configured to use ClamAV. For more information see: {c-icap-url}[c-icap on sourceforge] (for selecting ClamAV see their section: Selecting virus scan engine to use).

. Install ClamAV based on the instructions at the beginning of this document and `c-icap` as referenced above.

. To use ClamAV, set the mode to `c-icap with ClamAV` either from the Web interface or via command line:
+
[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:app:set files_antivirus \
    av_request_service --value="avscan"
----

. Set the respective response header:
+
[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:app:set files_antivirus \
    av_response_header --value="X-Infection-Found"
----

### Run with Kaspersky Anti-Virus (KAV)

. Install Kaspersky ScanEngine based on their {kasperski-scanengine-url}[instructions] and prepare KAV for running in ICAP mode.

. Follow this procedure to configure ownCloud for the Kaspersky ScanEngine.

. To use KAV, set the mode to `req` either from the Web interface or via command line:
+
[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:app:set files_antivirus \
    av_request_service --value="req"
----

. Set the respective response header:
+
[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:app:set files_antivirus \
    av_response_header --value="X-Virus-ID"
----
+
NOTE: Older versions of KAV did not send back the virus/infection name in an ICAP header. Starting with version 2.0.0 of KAV, you can configure the header to transport the virus. By default no header is sent.

=== Run with McAfee

Note, McAfee version 7.8.2 and up provide ICAP support. Follow this procedure to configure ownCloud for the McAfee virus scanner.

. Install McAfee based on their instructions.

. To use McAfee, set the mode to `wwreqmod` either from the Web interface or via command line:
+
[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:app:set files_antivirus \
    av_request_service --value="wwreqmod"
----
+
NOTE: McAfee does not offer predefined response headers.
