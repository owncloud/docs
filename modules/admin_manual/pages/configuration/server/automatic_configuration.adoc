= Automatic Configuration Setup
:toc: right

== Introduction

If you need to install ownCloud on multiple servers, you normally do not want to set up each instance 
separately as described in xref:configuration/database/linux_database_configuration.adoc[Database Configuration].
For this reason, ownCloud provides an automatic configuration feature.

To take advantage of this feature, you must create a configuration file,
called `config/autoconfig.php`, and set the file parameters as
required. You can specify any number of parameters in this file. Any
unspecified parameters appear on the "Finish setup" screen when you first launch ownCloud.

The `config/autoconfig.php` is automatically removed after the initial configuration has been applied.

== Parameters

When configuring parameters, you must understand that two parameters are
named differently in this configuration file when compared to the
standard config.php file.

== Automatic Configurations Examples

The following sections provide sample automatic configuration examples
and what information is requested at the end of the configuration.

=== Data Directory

Using the following parameter settings, the "Finish setup" screen
requests database and admin credentials settings.

----
<?php
$AUTOCONFIG = [
  "directory"     => "/www/htdocs/owncloud/data",
];
----

=== SQLite Database

Using the following parameter settings, the "Finish setup" screen
requests data directory and admin credentials settings.

----
<?php
$AUTOCONFIG = [
  "dbtype"        => "sqlite",
  "dbname"        => "owncloud",
  "dbtableprefix" => "",
];
----

=== MySQL Database

Using the following parameter settings, the "Finish setup" screen
requests data directory and admin credentials settings.

----
<?php
$AUTOCONFIG = [
  "dbtype"        => "mysql",
  "dbname"        => "owncloud",
  "dbuser"        => "username",
  "dbpass"        => "password",
  "dbhost"        => "localhost",
  "dbtableprefix" => "",
];
----

NOTE: Keep in mind that the automatic configuration does not eliminate the need for creating the database user and database in advance, as described in xref:configuration/database/linux_database_configuration.adoc[Database Configuration].

=== PostgreSQL Database

Using the following parameter settings, the "Finish setup" screen
requests data directory and admin credentials settings.

----
<?php
$AUTOCONFIG = [
  "dbtype"        => "pgsql",
  "dbname"        => "owncloud",
  "dbuser"        => "username",
  "dbpass"        => "password",
  "dbhost"        => "localhost",
  "dbtableprefix" => "",
];
----

=== All Parameters

Using the following parameter settings, because all parameters are
already configured in the file, the ownCloud installation skips the
"Finish setup" screen.

----
<?php
$AUTOCONFIG = [
  "dbtype"        => "mysql",
  "dbname"        => "owncloud",
  "dbuser"        => "username",
  "dbpass"        => "password",
  "dbhost"        => "localhost",
  "dbtableprefix" => "",
  "adminlogin"    => "root",
  "adminpass"     => "root-password",
  "directory"     => "/www/htdocs/owncloud/data",
];
