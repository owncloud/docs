= Two-factor Authentication

Marketplace URL: https://marketplace.owncloud.com/apps/twofactor_totp[2-Factor Authentication]

If a two-factor provider app is enabled, it is enabled for all users by default (though the provider can decide whether or not the user has to pass the challenge).
In the case of an user losing access to the second factor (e.g., a lost phone with two-factor SMS verification), the admin can temporarily disable the two-factor check for that user via the occ command:

== Command Description

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} twofactor:disable <username>
----

To re-enable two-factor authentication again, use the following command:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} twofactor:enable <username>
----
