NOTE: The user running the update command, which will likely be your webserver user, requires write permission for the `/apps` respectively `apps-external` folder.

NOTE: If they don’t have write permission, the command may report that the update was successful, but it may silently fail.

These commands are not available in single-user (maintenance) mode.
For more details please see the Maintenance Commands section in the occ core command set.

== Install an Application

Applications can be installed both from https://marketplace.owncloud.com/[the ownCloud Marketplace] and from a local file archive.

== Install Apps From The Marketplace

To install an application from the Marketplace, you need to supply the app’s id, which can be found in the app’s Marketplace URL.
For example, the URL for _Two factor backup codes_ is https://marketplace.owncloud.com/apps/twofactor_backup_codes.
So its app id is `twofactor_backup_codes`.
