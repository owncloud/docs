[width="100%",cols="20%,82%",]
|===
| `uid`       | User ID.
| `expiredate` | The date and time when a password expires, +
e.g. `2019-01-01 14:00:00 CET` or -1 days.
|===

TIP: The expiry date can be provided using any of {php-datetime-url}[PHP's supported date and time formats].

=== Options

[width="100%",cols="23%,82%",]
|===
| `-a, --all`
| Will add password expiry to all known users.
uid and group option are discarded if the option is provided by user.

| `-u [UID]` +
`--uid=[UID]`
| The uid of the user to expire the password for. +
To expire the password of multiple users, pass the `-u` or `--uid` option multiple times, as in this example: `--uid "Alice" --uid "Bob"`.

| `-g [GROUP]` +
`--group=[GROUP]`
| Add password expiry to user(s) in one or more groups. +
This option can be used as `--group foo --group bar` to add expiry passwords for users in multiple groups.
|===

If an expiry date is not supplied, the password will expire with immediate effect.
This is because the password will be set as being expired 24 hours before the command was run.
For example, if the command was run at `2018-07-**12** 13:15:28 UTC`, then the password's expiry
date will be set to `2018-07-**11** 13:15:28 UTC`.

After the command completes, console output, similar to that below, confirms when the user's password is set to expire.

----
The password for frank is set to expire on 2018-07-12 13:15:28 UTC.

== Caveats

Please be aware of the following implications of enabling or changing the password policy's "*days until user password expires*" option.

* Administrators need to run the `occ user:expire-password` command to initiate expiry for new users.
* Passwords will never expire for users who have *not* changed their initial password, because they do not have a password history.
  To force password expiration use the `occ user:expire-password` command.
* A password expiration date will be set after users change their password for the first time. 
  To force password expiration use the `occ user:expire-password` command.
* Passwords changed for the first time, will expire based on the *active* password policy. 
  If the policy is later changed, it will not update the password's expiry date to reflect the new setting.
* Password expiration dates of users where the administrator has run the `occ user:expire-password` command *won't* automatically update to reflect the policy change. 
  In these cases, Administrators need to run the `occ user:expire-password` command again and supply a new expiry date.
