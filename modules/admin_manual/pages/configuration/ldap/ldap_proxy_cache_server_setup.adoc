== Background

To reduce network traffic overhead and avoid problems either logging in or performing user searches while sharing, it's an excellent idea to implement an LDAP proxy cache.
An LDAP proxy cache server, similar to other kinds of caching servers, is a special type of LDAP replica. 
It can cache a range of LDAP records, often resulting in improved LDAP server performance.

Specifically, the records which need to be cached for improved ownCloud performance are:

* Users that are allowed to log in
* Groups (limited to the allowed users)
* Search fields (e.g., `sAMAccountName`, `CN`, `SN`, `givenName`, and `displayName`)

== How To Set Up the Server

To set up the LDAP Proxy-Cache server work through the following five steps:

1.  xref:install-openldap[Install OpenLDAP]
2.  xref:configure-the-server[Configure the Server]
3.  xref:enable-the-configuration-file[Enable the Configuration File]
4.  xref:open-the-log[Check the Log]
5.  xref:perform-a-test-search[Perform a Test Search]
6.  xref:configure-owncloud-ldap-app[Configure the ownCloud LDAP app]

[[install-openldap]]
=== Install OpenLDAP

There are a number of {list-of-ldap-url}[LDAP server implementations] available. 
The one used in this guide is {open-ldap-url}[OpenLDAP].

NOTE: While OpenLDAP does work on most of the common operating systems, for the purposes of this guide we'll be using a Debian-based Linux distribution.

First, update your system to ensure that you are using the latest packages.
Then, run the following command:

[source,console]
----
sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
----

Next, install OpenLDAP and its associated packages by running the following command:

[source,console]
----
sudo apt-get install slapd ldap-utils -y
----

[[configure-the-server]]
=== Configure the Server

With OpenLDAP installed and running, you now need to configure it. 
One way of doing so is to create a configuration file. 
Create `/etc/ldap/slapd.conf` with your text editor of choice, and add the following configuration to it.

[source,conf]
----
include::example$configuration/ldap/single.slapd.conf[]
----

NOTE: This configuration only caches queries from a single Active Directory server. 
To cache queries from multiple Active Directory servers, xref:cache-multiple-active-directory-servers[a configuration is available below].

After you've done that, save the file and test that there are no errors in the configuration by running:

[source,console]
----
sudo slaptest -f /etc/ldap/slapd.conf
----

NOTE: If you see warnings in the console output, they are not crucial.

=== Enable the Configuration File

Next, we need to tell OpenLDAP to use our configuration.
To do so, open `/etc/default/slapd` and add the following line to it:

....
SLAPD_CONF=/etc/ldap/slapd.conf
....

With that done, restart OpenLDAP by running the following command:

[source,console]
----
sudo service slapd restart
----

=== Open the Log

With OpenLDAP running, review {syslog-url}[the system log output] with the following command:

[source,console]
----
tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep QUERY
----

If there is no such file, you need to install a Syslog daemon. 
We recommend using {rsyslog-url}[Rsyslog].
To install it, run the following command:

[source,console]
----
sudo apt install rsyslog
----

=== Perform a Test Search

Now that the server's installed, configured, and running, we next need to perform a test search. 
This will check that records are being correctly cached. 
To do so, run one of the following commands below, after updating it with values from your Active Directory server configuration.

[source]
----
sudo ldapsearch -h localhost -x -LLL \
    -D "cn=admin,cn=users,dc=example,dc=com" \
    -b "cn=users,dc=example,dc=com" \
    -w "Password" "(cn=Administrator)" name
----

[source]
----
sudo ldapsearch -H ldaps://localhost:636 -x -LLL \
    -D "cn=admin,cn=users,dc=example,dc=com" \
    -b "cn=users,dc=example,dc=com" \
    -W "(cn=Administrator)" name
----

.Description of Options
[width="100%",cols="20%,80%",options="header",]
|===
| Option
| Description

| -h
| Host address (Example: `localhost` or `192.168.1.1`)

| -H
| Host address (Example: `ldap://` or `ldaps://` hostname or ip and port `:389` or `:636`)

| -x
| Simple authentication

| -b
| Search Base, (Example: `cn=Users,dc=example,dc=com`)

| -D
| User with permissions (Example: `cn=Admin,dc=example,dc=com`)

| -LLL
| Show only results, no extra information

| -w
| Password ("Password")

| -W
| Password, will ask for password and hide your input

| `(cn=Administrator)`
| Filter the search

| name
| Show only these attributes
|===

If the results include: `"Query cachable"` and `"Query answered (x) times"`, then the setup works.

=== Configure ownCloud LDAP App

Configuring the ownCloud LDAP application involves several step; these are:

* xref:enable-the-ldap-application[Enable the LDAP application]
* xref:configure-the-ldap-application[Configure the LDAP application]

==== Enable the LDAP Application

First, login to your ownCloud server as an ownCloud admin; then:

* Click on the menu:Settings[] dropdown menu in the top-right corner.
** Then, click on menu:Admin[Apps].
** Click on btn:[Show Disabled Apps] and enable the "_LDAP Integration_" app, and reload the page.
* Click on the menu in the left-hand side, menu:Admin[User Authentication].
** Select `LDAP`, if available and not already selected.

==== Configure the LDAP Application

image::configuration/ldap/ldap-configuration-form.png[ownCloud's LDAP configuration form.]

* Select the menu:Server[] tab.
** In the first field, enter the server address (either the IP address or hostname). +
   TIP: You can click on the button to detect your server's port or enter it manually.
** In the next two fields, enter the user `DN` of the user you want to log in with, and the password.
** Click on btn:[Detect Base DN], or enter the base DN manually.
** Click on btn:[Test Base DN].

* If you fulfill all the requirements, you should get a green light and see the message: `Configuration OK`.

* Select menu:Users[] tab.
** Select the `objectclass` for the users, for example `user`.
** Click btn:[Verify settings and count users] near the bottom of the form.
You will then see the number of users found.

* Select menu:Login Attributes[] tab.
** A configuration appears; adjust it to your users configuration.
** If required, adjust the login parameters additional login attributes.
** You can check users with any of the allowed login options.
You can adjust them or leave them the way they are.

* Select menu:Groups[] tab.
** Select all the `objectclasses` for your groups, for example `group`. 
   Then, verify your settings

* Select menu:Advanced[] tab.
** Under "Configuration Settings":
   * Configuration Active should be selected.
   * Adjust the Cache TTL (time to live) value as required. 
     However, ownCloud usually auto-selects the best settings for each AD configuration.
** Under "Directory Settings"
   * Check if the Group-Member association is `Member (AD)`. 
     This is important for the users being shown in their respective groups.
   * Select `Nested groups`, if you have them.

* Select menu:Expert[] tab.
** In the "Internal Username Attribute" field, we need to set `CN` for the users being shown with their unique name. 
   If you leave that field empty, each user will get a unique UID as a string of numbers and letters.
** At the bottom of the form, click both btn:[Clear Username-LDAP User Mapping] and btn:[Clear Groupname-LDAP Group Mapping], and then test your configuration by clicking btn:[Test Configuration].

* Navigate to our ownCloud `User` administration page and check if all your users are listed properly, and shown in the right groups.
* Go to the homepage of your ownCloud server and try to share something with one of your users

If everything is set up correctly, you now have an LDAP proxy server to your active directory that will reduce the network traffic by caching the searches your perform.

== Cache Multiple Active Directory Servers

If you have more than one Active Directory Server that you want to cache, in `/etc/ldap/slapd.conf` add the following configuration instead, adjusting it as necessary. 
The ownCloud LDAP app settings are the same as in section 6.

[source,conf]
----
include::example$configuration/ldap/Multi-AD.slapd.conf[]
