== Introduction

If you have trouble installing, configuring or maintaining ownCloud,
please refer to our community support channels:

* https://central.owncloud.org[The ownCloud Forum]

NOTE: The ownCloud forum have a https://owncloud.org/faq/[FAQ category]
where each topic corresponds to typical errors or frequently occurring issues.

* https://mailman.owncloud.org/mailman/listinfo/user[The ownCloud User mailing list]

Please understand that all these channels essentially consist of users
like you helping each other out. Consider helping others out where you
can, to contribute back for the help you get. This is the only way to
keep a community like ownCloud healthy and sustainable!

If you are using ownCloud in a business or otherwise large scale
deployment, note that ownCloud Inc. offers the
https://owncloud.com/standard-or-enterprise/[Enterprise Edition]
with commercial support options.

== Bugs

If you think you have found a bug in ownCloud, please:

* Search for a solution (see the options above)
* Double-check your configuration

If you can’t find a solution, please use our 
xref:developer_manual:bugtracker/index.adoc[bugtracker].
You can generate a configuration report with the 
xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#config-commands[occ config command], 
with passwords automatically obscured.

== General Troubleshooting

Check the ownCloud xref:installation/system_requirements.adoc[System Requirements], especially supported browser versions.
When you see warnings about `code integrity`, refer to xref:configuration/general_topics/code_signing.adoc[Code Signing].

=== Disable Third-Party Apps

Third-party apps may cause problems during upgrades.
To avoid this happening, we strongly encourage administrators to always disable xref:maintenance/manual_upgrade.adoc#review-third-party-apps[third-party apps] before upgrades, and for troubleshooting purposes.

=== ownCloud Logfiles

In a standard ownCloud installation the log level is set to `Normal`.
To find any issues you need to raise the log level to `All` in your `config.php` file, or to *Everything* on your ownCloud Admin page.
Please see xref:configuration/server/logging/logging_configuration.adoc[Logging Configuration] for more information on these log levels.

Some logging - for example JavaScript console logging - needs debugging
enabled. Edit config/config.php and change `'debug' => false,` to
`'debug' => true,` Be sure to change it back when you are finished.

For JavaScript issues you will also need to view the javascript console.
All major browsers have developer tools for viewing the console, and you
usually access them by pressing F12. For Firefox we recommend to
installing the https://getfirebug.com/[Firebug extension].

NOTE: The logfile of ownCloud is located in the data directory `owncloud/data/owncloud.log`.

=== PHP Version and Information

You will need to know your PHP version and configurations. To do this,
create a plain-text file named *phpinfo.php* and place it in your Web
root, for example `/var/www/html/phpinfo.php`. (Your Web root may be in
a different location; your Linux distribution documentation will tell
you where.) This file contains just this line:

[source,php]
----
<?php phpinfo(); ?>
----

Open this file in a Web browser by pointing your browser to
`localhost/phpinfo.php`:

image:phpinfo.png[image]

Your PHP version is at the top, and the rest of the page contains
abundant system information such as active modules, active `.ini` files,
and much more. When you are finished reviewing your information you must
delete `phpinfo.php`, or move it outside of your Web directory, because
it is a security risk to expose such sensitive data.

=== Debugging Sync Issues

IMPORTANT: The data directory on the server is exclusive to ownCloud and must not be modified manually.

Disregarding this can lead to unwanted behaviours like:

* Problems with sync clients
* Undetected changes due to caching in the database

If you need to directly upload files from the same server please use a
WebDAV command line client like `cadaver` to upload files to the WebDAV
interface at:

`\https://example.com/owncloud/remote.php/dav`

=== Common problems / error messages

Some common problems / error messages found in your logfiles as
described above:

* `SQLSTATE[HY000] [1040] Too many connections` -> You need to increase the connection limit of your database, please refer to the manual of your database for more information.
* `SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 5 database is locked` -> You’re using `SQLite` which can’t handle a lot of parallel requests. Please consider converting to another database like described in xref:configuration/database/db_conversion.adoc[converting Database Type].
* `SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 2006 MySQL server has gone away` -> Please refer to xref:configuration/database/linux_database_configuration.adoc#database-configuration-troubleshooting[Troubleshooting] for more information.
* `SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002] No such file or directory` -> There is a problem accessing your SQLite database file in your data directory (`data/owncloud.db`). Please check the permissions of this folder/file or if it exists at all. If you’re using MySQL please start your database.
* `Connection closed / Operation cancelled` or `expected filesize 4734206 got 458752` -> This could be caused by wrong 
`KeepAlive` settings within your Apache config. Make sure that `KeepAlive` is set to `On` and also try to raise the 
limits of `KeepAliveTimeout` and `MaxKeepAliveRequests`. On Apache with `mod_php` using a xref:installation/manual_installation.adoc#multi-processing-module-mpm[multi-processing module] other than `prefork` could be another reason. 
Further information is available https://central.owncloud.org/t/expected-filesize-xxx-got-yyy-0/816[in the forums].
* `No basic authentication headers were found` -> This error is shown in your `data/owncloud.log` file. 
Some Apache modules like `mod_fastcgi`, `mod_fcgid` or `mod_proxy_fcgi` are not passing the needed authentication 
headers to PHP and so the login to ownCloud via WebDAV, CalDAV and CardDAV clients is failing. 
More information on how to correctly configure your environment can be found 
https://central.owncloud.org/t/no-basic-authentication-headers-were-found-message/819[at the forums].

== OAuth2

=== ownCloud clients cannot connect to the ownCloud server

If ownCloud clients cannot connect to your ownCloud server, check to see
if PROPFIND requests receive `HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized` responses. If
this is happening, more than likely your webserver configuration is
stripping out https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750[the bearer authorization header].

If you’re using the Apache web server, add the following `SetEnvIf`
directive to your Apache configuration, whether in the general Apache
config, in a configuration include file, or in ownCloud’s .htaccess
file.

----
SetEnvIf Authorization "(.*)" HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=$1
----


== Missing Data Directory

During the normal course of operations, the ownCloud data directory may
be temporarily unavailable for a variety of reasons. These can include
network timeouts on mounted network disks, unintentional unmounting of
the partition on which the directory sits, or a corruption of the RAID
setup. If you have experienced this, here’s how ownCloud works and what
you can expect.

During normal operation, ownCloud’s data directory contains a hidden
file, named `.ocdata`. The purpose of this file is for setups where the
data folder is mounted (such as via NFS) and for some reason the mount
disappeared. If the directory isn’t available, the data folder would, in
effect, be completely empty and the `.ocdata` would be missing. When
this happens, ownCloud will return a
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#5xx_Server_Error[503 Service not available]
error, to prevent clients believing that the files are gone.

== Troubleshooting Web server and PHP problems

=== Logfiles

When having issues the first step is to check the logfiles provided by
PHP, the Web server and ownCloud itself.

NOTE: In the following the paths to the logfiles of a default Debian installation running Apache2 with mod_php is assumed. On other Web servers, Linux distros or operating systems they can differ.

* The logfile of Apache2 is located in `/var/log/apache2/error.log`.
* The logfile of PHP can be configured in your
`/etc/php5/apache2/php.ini`. You need to set the directive `log_errors`
to `On` and choose the path to store the logfile in the `error_log`
directive. After those changes you need to restart your Web server.
* The logfile of ownCloud is located in the data directory
`/var/www/owncloud/data/owncloud.log`.

=== Web Server and PHP Modules

NOTE: https://www.lighttpd.net/[Lighttpd] is not supported with ownCloud — and some ownCloud features
may not work _at all_ on Lighttpd.

There are some Web server or PHP modules which are known to cause
various problems like broken up-/downloads. The following shows a draft
overview of these modules:

==== Apache

* libapache2-mod-php5filter (use libapache2-mod-php5 instead)
* mod_dav
* mod_deflate
* mod_evasive
* mod_pagespeed
* mod_proxy_html (can cause broken PDF downloads)
* mod_reqtimeout
* mod_security
* mod_spdy together with libapache2-mod-php5 / mod_php (use fcgi or php-fpm instead)
* mod_xsendfile / X-Sendfile (causing broken downloads if not configured correctly)

==== PHP

* eAccelerator

== Troubleshooting WebDAV

=== General troubleshooting

ownCloud uses SabreDAV, and the SabreDAV documentation is comprehensive and helpful.

See:

* http://sabre.io/dav/faq/[SabreDAV FAQ]
* http://sabre.io/dav/webservers[Web servers] (Lists lighttpd as not recommended)
* http://sabre.io/dav/large-files/[Working with large files]
(Shows a PHP bug in older SabreDAV versions and information for mod_security problems)
* http://sabre.io/dav/0bytes[0 byte files] (Reasons for empty files on the server)
* http://sabre.io/dav/clients/[Clients]
(A comprehensive list of WebDAV clients, and possible problems with each one)
* http://sabre.io/dav/clients/finder/[Finder, OS X’s built-in WebDAV client]
(Describes problems with Finder on various Web servers)

There is also a well maintained FAQ thread available at the
https://central.owncloud.org/t/how-to-fix-caldav-carddav-webdav-problems/852[ownCloud Forums]
which contains various additional information about WebDAV problems.

=== Error 0x80070043 `The network name cannot be found.` while adding a network drive

The windows native WebDAV client might fail with the following error message:

----
Error 0x80070043 "The network name cannot be found." while adding a network drive
----

A known workaround for this issue is to update your web server
configuration.

*Apache*

You need to add the following rule set to your main web server or
virtual host configuration, or the `.htaccess` file in your document
root.

[source,apache]
----
# Fixes Windows WebDav client error 0x80070043 "The network name cannot be found."
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^(DavClnt)$
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} ^(OPTIONS)$
RewriteRule .* - [R=401,L]
----

== Troubleshooting Contacts & Calendar

=== Service Discovery

Some clients - especially on iOS/Mac OS X - have problems finding the
proper sync URL, even when explicitly configured to use it.

If you want to use CalDAV or CardDAV clients together with ownCloud it
is important to have a correct working setup of the following URLs:

[verse]
--
`\https://example.com/.well-known/carddav`
`\https://example.com/.well-known/caldav`

--

Those need to be redirecting your clients to the correct DAV endpoints.
If running ownCloud at the document root of your Web server the correct
URL is:

`\https://example.com/remote.php/dav`

and if running in a subfolder like `owncloud`:

`\https://example.com/owncloud/remote.php/dav`

For the first case the .htaccess file shipped with ownCloud should do
this work for your when running Apache. You only need to make sure that
your Web server is using this file.

If your ownCloud instance is installed in a subfolder called `owncloud`
and you’re running Apache create or edit the .htaccess file within the
document root of your Web server and add the following lines:

[source,apache]
----
Redirect 301 /.well-known/carddav /owncloud/remote.php/dav
Redirect 301 /.well-known/caldav /owncloud/remote.php/dav
----

Now change the URL in the client settings to just use:

`\https://example.com`

instead of e.g.

`\https://example.com/owncloud/remote.php/dav/principals/username`.

There are also several techniques to remedy this, which are described
extensively at the http://sabre.io/dav/service-discovery/[Sabre DAV website].

=== Unable to update Contacts or Events

If you get an error like:

`PATCH \https://example.com/remote.php/dav HTTP/1.0 501 Not Implemented`

it is likely caused by one of the following reasons:

Using Pound reverse-proxy/load balancer::
  As of writing this Pound doesn’t support the HTTP/1.1 verb. Pound is easily
  http://www.apsis.ch/pound/pound_list/archive/2013/2013-08/1377264673000[patched] to support HTTP/1.1.

Misconfigured Web server::
  Your Web server is misconfigured and blocks the needed DAV methods.
  Please refer to xref:troubleshooting-webdav[Troubleshooting WebDAV] above for troubleshooting steps.

== Client Sync Stalls

One known reason is stray locks. These should expire automatically after an hour.
If stray locks don’t expire (identified by e.g. repeated `file.txt is locked` and/or `Exception\\\\FileLocked` messages in your data/owncloud.log), make sure that you are running system cron and not Ajax cron (See xref:configuration/server/background_jobs_configuration.adoc[Background Jobs]).
See https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/22116 and
https://central.owncloud.org/t/file-is-locked-how-to-unlock/985
for some discussion and additional info of this issue.

== Other issues

Some services like _Cloudflare_ can cause issues by minimizing
JavaScript and loading it only when needed. When having issues like a
not working login button or creating new users make sure to disable such
services first.
