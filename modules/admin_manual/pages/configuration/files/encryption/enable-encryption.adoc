:description: This guide will show you how to enable the encryption app in ownCloud.
:page-partial:

Before you can use encryption you must enable the encryption app. 
You can do this either from the command-line or from the Web-UI.

== Enable Encryption From the Command-Line
// tag::enable-encryption-app-via-command-line[]
To enable the encryption app, run the following command:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} app:enable encryption
----

If the encryption app successfully enables, then you should see the
following confirmation:

----
encryption enabled
----

[NOTE]
====
This should never happen, but the encryption app may not be packaged with your ownCloud installation. 
If so, you will see the following output when you attempt to enable it:

[source,console]
----
encryption not found
----

If that happens, then you need to install it manually. 
You can do this by cloning the encryption app, using the following command:

[source,console]
----
git clone https://github.com/owncloud/encryption.git apps/encryption
----
====
// end::enable-encryption-app-via-command-line[]

== Enable Encryption From the Web-UI

To enable encryption from the Web-UI:

. Go to menu:Settings[Admin > Apps] and click on kbd:[Show disabled apps]
. When the disabled apps are rendered click btn:[Enable] under _"Default encryption module"_.
. After that go to menu:Settings[Admin > Encryption], and enable btn:[Enable server-side encryption].
. Then, under _"Default encryption module"_, select the desired encryption type, whether _"Master Key"_ (recommended) or _"User-key"_.
. Now you must log out and then log back in to initialize your encryption keys.
