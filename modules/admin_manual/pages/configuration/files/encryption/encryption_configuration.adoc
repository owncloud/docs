== Background Information

The primary purpose of the ownCloud server-side encryption is to protect
users’ files when they’re located on remote storages, such as Dropbox
and Google Drive, and to do it smoothly and seamlessly from within
ownCloud.

From ownCloud 9.0, server-side encryption for local and remote storages
can operate independently of each other. By doing so, you can encrypt a
remote storage _without_ also having to encrypt your home storage on
your ownCloud server.

NOTE: Starting with ownCloud 9.0 we support Authenticated Encryption for all newly encrypted files. 
See https://hackerone.com/reports/108082 for more technical information about the impact.

For maximum security make sure to configure external storage with
"_Check for changes: Never_". This will let ownCloud ignore new
files not added via ownCloud. By doing so, a malicious external storage
administrator cannot add new files to the storage without your
knowledge. However, this is not wise _if_ your external storage is
subject to legitimate external changes.

ownCloud’s server-side encryption encrypts files stored on the ownCloud
server and files on remote storages that are connected to your ownCloud
server. Encryption and decryption are performed on the ownCloud server.
All files sent to remote storage will be encrypted by the ownCloud
server and decrypted before serving them to you or anyone whom you have
shared them with.

NOTE: Encrypting files increases their size by roughly 35%. Remember to take this into account when you are both provisioning storage and setting storage quotas. Secondly, user quotas are based on the _unencrypted_ file size — *not* the encrypted size.

When files on an external storage are encrypted in ownCloud, you cannot
share them directly from the external storage services, only through
ownCloud sharing. This is because the key to decrypt the data *never*
leaves the ownCloud server.

ownCloud’s server-side encryption generates a strong encryption key,
which is unlocked by users’ passwords. As a result, your users don’t
need to track an extra password. All they need to do is log in as they
normally would. ownCloud, transparently, encrypts only the contents of
files, and not filenames and directory structures.

IMPORTANT: You should regularly backup all encryption keys to prevent permanent data loss.

The encryption keys are stored in the following directories:

[width="90%",cols="20%,80%",options="header",]
|===
| Directory
| Description
| `data/<user>/files_encryption`
| Users’ private keys and all other keys necessary to decrypt the users’ files.
| `data/files_encryption`
| Private keys and all other keys necessary to decrypt the files stored on a system wide external storage.
|===

NOTE: You can move the keys to a different location. To do so, refer to the xref:move-key-location[Move Key Location] section of the documentation.

When encryption is enabled, all files are encrypted and decrypted by the
ownCloud application, and stored encrypted on your remote storage. This
protects your data on externally hosted storage. The ownCloud admin and
the storage admin will see only encrypted files when browsing backend
storage.

Encryption keys are stored only on the ownCloud server, eliminating
exposure of your data to third-party storage providers. The encryption
application does *not* protect your data if your ownCloud server is
compromised, and it does not prevent ownCloud administrators from
reading users’ files.

This would require client-side encryption, which
this application does not provide. If your ownCloud server is not
connected to any external storage services, it is better to use other
encryption tools, such as file-level or whole-disk encryption.

[CAUTION]
====
SSL terminates at or before the webserver on the ownCloud server.
Consequently, all files are in an unencrypted state between the SSL connection
termination and the ownCloud code that encrypts and decrypts them.
This is, potentially, exploitable by anyone with administrator access to your server.
For more information, read: https://owncloud.org/blog/how-owncloud-uses-encryption-to-protect-your-data/[How ownCloud uses encryption to protect your data].
====

== Encryption Types

ownCloud provides two encryption types:

[width="90%",cols="20%,80%",]
|===
| *User-Key:*
| Every user has their own private/public key pairs, and the private key is protected by the user’s password.
| *Master Key:*
| There is only one key (or key pair) and all files are encrypted using that key pair.
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
These encryption types are *not compatible*.
====

== Before Enabling Encryption

Plan very carefully before enabling encryption, because it is not
reversible via the ownCloud Web interface. If you lose your encryption
keys, your files are *not* recoverable. Always have backups of your
encryption keys stored in a safe location, and consider enabling all
recovery options.

You have more options via xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#encryption[the `occ` command’s encryption options].


[IMPORTANT]
====
You can’t manage encryption without access to the command line.
If your ownCloud installation is on a hosted environment and you don’t have access to the command line, you won’t be able to run xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc[occ commands].
In this case, *don’t enable encryption*!
====

=== Enabling Master Key Based Encryption from the Command-Line

To enable encryption via the command-line, involves several commands.
Firstly, enable the default encryption module app, using the following command:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} app:enable encryption
----

Then enable encryption, using the following command:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} encryption:enable
----

After that, enable the master key, using the following command:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} encryption:select-encryption-type masterkey
----

NOTE: The master key mode has to be set up in a newly created instance.

Finally, encrypt all data, using the following command:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} encryption:encrypt-all --yes
----

NOTE: This command is not typically required, as the master key is often enabled at install time.
As a result, when enabling it, there should be no data to encrypt.
But, in case it’s being enabled after install, and the installation does have files which are unencrypted, xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#encrypt-all[encrypt-all] can be used to encrypt them.

== View Current Encryption Status

Get the current encryption status and the loaded encryption module:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} encryption:status
----

This is equivalent to checking Enable server-side encryption on your Admin page:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} encryption:enable
Encryption enabled

Default module: OC_DEFAULT_MODULE
----

== Recreating an Existing Master Key

If the master key needs replacing, for example, because it has been compromised, an occ command is available.
The command is xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#recreate-master-key[encryption:recreate-master-key].
It replaces existing master key with new one and encrypts the files with the new key.

== Decrypt Master-Key Encryption

You must first put your ownCloud server into single-user mode to prevent any user activity until encryption is completed.

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} maintenance:singleuser --on
Single user mode is currently enabled
----

Decrypt all user data files, or optionally a single user:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} encryption:decrypt-all [username]
----

== Disabling Encryption

To disable encryption, put your ownCloud server into single-user mode, and then disable your encryption module with these commands:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} maintenance:singleuser --on
{occ-command-example-prefix} encryption:disable
----

Take it out of single-user mode when you are finished, by using the following command:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} maintenance:singleuser --off
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
You may only disable encryption by using the xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#encryption[occ Encryption Commands].
Make sure you have backups of all encryption keys, including those for all your users.
====

== Enabling User-Key Based Encryption From the Command-line

=== Limitations of User-Key Based Encryption

* Users added to groups cannot decrypt files on existing shares.
* OnlyOffice will not work.
* Impersonate will not work.
* OAuth2 does will not work.
* Elasticsearch will not work.
* Users getting access to an external storage which already contains existing encrypted files cannot get access to said files for reasons such as the group case above.
* When having data shared with a group and group membership changes after the share is established, subsequently added users will not be able to open the shared data unless the owner will share it again.

To enable User-Key based encryption:

To be safe, put your server in single user mode, to avoid any issues on a running instance, using the following command:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} maintenance:singleuser --on
----

Then, enable the default encryption module app, using the following command:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} app:enable encryption
----

After that, enable encryption, using the following command:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} encryption:enable
----

Then, enable the user-key, using the following command:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} encryption:select-encryption-type user-keys
----

Finally, encrypt all data, using the following command:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} encryption:encrypt-all --yes
----

Now you can turn off the single user mode:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} maintenance:singleuser --off
----


== How To Enable Users File Recovery Keys

Once a user has encrypted their files, if they lose their ownCloud
password, then they lose access to their encrypted files, as their files
will be unrecoverable. It is not possible, when user files are
encrypted, to reset a user’s password using the standard reset process.

If so, you’ll see a yellow banner warning:

""
Please provide an admin recovery password; otherwise, all user data will be lost.
""

To avoid all this, create a Recovery Key. To do so, go to the Encryption
section of your Admin page and set a recovery key password.

image:configuration/files/encryption10.png[image]

You then need to ask your users to opt-in to the Recovery Key. For the
users to do this, they need to go to the `**Personal**` page and
enable the recovery key. This signals that they are OK that the admin
might have a way to decrypt their data for recovery reasons. If they do
_not_ do this, then the Recovery Key won’t work for them.

image:configuration/files/encryption7.png[image]

For users who have enabled password recovery, give them a new password
and recover access to their encrypted files, by supplying the Recovery
Key on the Users page.

image:configuration/files/encryption8.png[image]

You may change your recovery key password.

image:configuration/files/encryption12.png[image]

NOTE: Sharing a recovery key with a user group is *not* supported.
This is only supported with xref:recreating-an-existing-master-key[the master key].

== Changing The Recovery Key Password

If you have misplaced your recovery key password and need to replace it,
here’s what you need to do:

1.  Delete the recovery key from both `data/owncloud_private_keys` and
`data/public-keys`
2.  Edit your database table `oc_appconfig` and remove the rows with the
config keys `recoveryKeyId` and `recoveryAdminEnabled` for the appid
`files_encryption`
3.  Login as admin and activate the recovery key again with a new
password. This will generate a new key pair
4.  All users who used the original recovery key will need to disable it
and enable it again. This deletes the old recovery share keys from their
files and encrypts their files with the new recovery key

NOTE: You can only change the recovery key password if you know the original. This is by design, as only admins who know the recovery key password should be able to change it. If not, admins could hijack the recovery key from each other

IMPORTANT: Replacing the recovery key will mean that all users will lose the possibility to recover their files until they have applied the new recovery key.

== Decrypt User-Key Encryption

You must first put your ownCloud server into single-user mode, to prevent any user activity until encryption is completed.

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} maintenance:singleuser --on
Single user mode is currently enabled
----


== Disabling Encryption

You may disable encryption only with `occ`. Make sure you have backups
of all the encryption keys, including those for all users. When you do,
put your ownCloud server into single-user mode, and then disable your
encryption module with this command:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} maintenance:singleuser --on
{occ-command-example-prefix} encryption:disable
----

IMPORTANT: Encryption cannot be disabled without the user’s password or
xref:how-to-enable-users-file-recovery-keys[file recovery key].
If you don’t have access to at least one of these then there is no way to decrypt all files.

Then, take it out of single-user mode when you are finished with this
command:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} maintenance:singleuser --off
----

It is possible to disable encryption with the file recovery key, _if_ every user uses them.
If so, "decrypt all" will use it to decrypt all files.

NOTE: It is *not* planned to move this to the next user login or a background job. If that was done, then login passwords would need to be stored in the database, which could be a security issue.

== Move Key Location

View current location of keys:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} encryption:show-key-storage-root
Current key storage root:  default storage location (data/)
----

You can move the keys to another folder inside your data directory. Moving your keys outside of your data folder is not supported.
The folder must already exist, be owned by root and your HTTP group, and be restricted to root and your HTTP group.
This example is for Ubuntu Linux.
Note that the new folder is relative to your occ directory:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
mkdir /var/www/owncloud/data/new_keys
chown -R root:www-data /var/www/owncloud/data/new_keys
chmod -R 0770 /var/www/owncloud/data/new_keys
{occ-command-example-prefix} encryption:change-key-storage-root new_keys
Change key storage root from default storage location to new_keys
Start to move keys:
   4 [============================]
Key storage root successfully changed to new_keys
----

include::{partialsdir}/configuration/files/not-encrypted-files.adoc[]

== LDAP and Other External User Back-ends

If you use an external user back-end, such as an LDAP or Samba server, and you change a user’s password on that back-end, the user will be prompted to change their ownCloud login to match on their next ownCloud login.
The user will need both their old and new passwords to do this.

If you have enabled the recovery key, then you can change a user’s password in the ownCloud Users panel to match their back-end password, and then — of course — notify the user and give them their new password.

== Encrypting External Mountpoints

You and your users can encrypt individual external mount points. You must have external storage enabled on your Admin page, and enabled for your users. Encryption settings can be configured in the mount options for an external storage mount; see xref:configuration/files/external_storage_configuration_gui.adoc#mount-options[Mount Options].

== Sharing Encrypted Files

After encryption is enabled, your users must also log out and log back in to generate their personal encryption keys. They will see a yellow warning banner that says "Encryption App is enabled, but your keys are not initialized. Please log-out and log-in again."

Also, share owners may need to re-share files after encryption is enabled. Users who are trying to access the share will see a message advising them to ask the share owner to re-share the file with them.

For individual shares, un-share and re-share the file. For group shares, share with any individuals who can't access the share. This updates the encryption, and then the share owner can remove the individual shares.

== How To Enable Encryption From the Web-UI

. First, you must enable the encrypton app, and then select an encryption type.
Go to the Apps section of your Admin page, click on btn:[Show disabled Apps] and enable "*Default encryption module*".
. After that go to the encryption section of your Admin page, and check the checkbox btn:[Enable server-side encryption].
. Then select an encryption Type. Masterkey and User-key are the options. Masterkey is recommended.
. Now you must log out and then log back in to initialize your encryption keys.
