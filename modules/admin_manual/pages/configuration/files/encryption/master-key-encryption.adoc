:description: This guide will show you how to work with Master Key encryption in ownCloud. 

== Introduction

With Master Key based encryption, there is only one key (or key pair) and all files are encrypted
using that key pair. This is highly recommended for new instances to avoid restrictions in
functionality of user key encryption.

== Enabling Master Key Based Encryption

There are two steps to be made to enable Master Key based encryption.

[TIP]
====
We strongly encourage you to put your server in single user mode before setting up encryption.

To do so, run the following command:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} maintenance:singleuser --on
----
====

=== Enable the Encryption App

include::enable-encryption.adoc[leveloffset=+1,tag=enable-encryption-app-via-command-line]

=== Enable and Configure Master Key Based Encryption

To enable and configure Master Key based encryption via the command-line, involves several commands.

. Enable encryption.
. Enable the master key.
+
NOTE: Master Key Mode has to be setup in a newly created instance.
. Encrypt all data.

The following example shows how to carry out these steps.

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} encryption:enable
{occ-command-example-prefix} encryption:select-encryption-type masterkey
{occ-command-example-prefix} encryption:encrypt-all --yes
----

NOTE: This command is not typically required, as the master key is often enabled at install time.
As a result, when enabling it, there _should_ be no data to encrypt.
However, if you have enabled master key encryption post-installation, existing files will not be automatically encrypted; *only* newly created files. 
To encrypt existing files use xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#encrypt-all[the encrypt-all command] as described above. 
Before doing so, set the instance into xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#maintenance-commands[single user mode] for that task.

== View Current Encryption Status

Retrieves the current encryption status and the name of the loaded encryption module.

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} encryption:status
----

This is equivalent to checking "Enable server-side encryption" on your Admin page:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} encryption:enable
Encryption enabled

Default module: OC_DEFAULT_MODULE
----

== Recreate an Existing Master Key

If the master key needs replacing, for example, because it has been compromised, an occ command is available.
The command is xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#recreate-master-key[encryption:recreate-master-key].
It replaces existing master key with new one and encrypts the files with the new key.

== Decrypt Master-Key Based Encryption

You must first put your ownCloud server into single-user mode to prevent any user activity until encryption is completed.

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} maintenance:singleuser --on
Single user mode is currently enabled
----

Decrypt all user data files, or optionally a single user:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} encryption:decrypt-all [username]
----

== Disable Encryption

To disable encryption, put your ownCloud server into single-user mode, and then disable your encryption module with these commands:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} maintenance:singleuser --on
{occ-command-example-prefix} encryption:disable
----

Take it out of single-user mode when you are finished, by using the following command:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} maintenance:singleuser --off
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
You may only disable encryption by using the xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#encryption[occ Encryption Commands].
Make sure you have backups of all encryption keys, including those for all your users.
