= LDAP and Other External User Backends

If you use an external user back-end, such as an LDAP or Samba server, and you change a user's password on that back-end, the user will be prompted to change their ownCloud login to match on their next ownCloud login.
The user will need both their old and new passwords to do this.

If you have enabled the recovery key, then — _as an ownCloud admin_ — you can change a user's password in the ownCloud Users panel to match their back-end password, and then — of course — notify the user and give them their new password.
