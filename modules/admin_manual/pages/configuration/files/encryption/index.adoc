= Encryption Configuration
:toc:

== Background Information

The primary purpose of the ownCloud server-side encryption is to protect
users' files when they're located on remote storages, such as Dropbox
and Google Drive, and to do it smoothly and seamlessly from within
ownCloud.

From ownCloud 9.0, server-side encryption for local and remote storages
can operate independently of each other. By doing so, you can encrypt a
remote storage _without_ also having to encrypt your home storage on
your ownCloud server.

NOTE: Starting with ownCloud 9.0 we support Authenticated Encryption for all newly encrypted files. See https://hackerone.com/reports/108082[HackerOne report 108082] for more technical information about the impact.

For maximum security make sure to configure external storage with
"_Check for changes: Never_". This will let ownCloud ignore new
files not added via ownCloud. By doing so, a malicious external storage
administrator cannot add new files to the storage without your
knowledge. However, this is not wise _if_ your external storage is
subject to legitimate external changes.

ownCloud's server-side encryption encrypts files stored on the ownCloud
server and files on remote storages that are connected to your ownCloud
server. Encryption and decryption are performed on the ownCloud server.
All files sent to remote storage will be encrypted by the ownCloud
server and decrypted before serving them to you or anyone whom you have
shared them with.

NOTE: *Encrypting files increases their size by roughly 35%.* Remember to take this into account when you are both provisioning storage and setting storage quotas. Secondly, user quotas are based on the _unencrypted_ file size — *not* the encrypted size.

When files on an external storage are encrypted in ownCloud, you cannot
share them directly from the external storage services, only through
ownCloud sharing. This is because the key to decrypt the data *never*
leaves the ownCloud server.

ownCloud's server-side encryption generates a strong encryption key,
which is unlocked by users' passwords. As a result, your users don't
need to track an extra password. All they need to do is log in as they
normally would. ownCloud, transparently, encrypts only the contents of
files, and not filenames and directory structures.

IMPORTANT: You should regularly backup all encryption keys to prevent permanent data loss.

== Encryption Key Locations

The encryption keys are stored in the following directories:

[cols="20%,80%",options="header",]
|===
| Directory
| Description

| `data/<user>/files_encryption`
| Users' private keys and all other keys necessary to decrypt the users' files.

| `data/files_encryption`
| Private keys and all other keys necessary to decrypt the files stored on a system wide external storage.
|===

NOTE: You can move the keys to a different location. To do so, refer to the xref:configuration/files/encryption/moving-key-locations.adoc[Move Key Location] section of the documentation.

== Encryption Keys and Encrypted Data

When encryption is enabled, all files are encrypted and decrypted by the ownCloud application, and stored encrypted on your remote storage.
This protects your data on externally hosted storage.
The ownCloud admin and the storage admin will see only encrypted files when browsing backend storage.

Encryption keys are stored only on the ownCloud server, eliminating exposure of your data to third-party storage providers.
The encryption application does *not* protect your data if your ownCloud server is compromised, and it does not prevent ownCloud administrators from reading users' files.

This would require client-side encryption, which this application does not provide.
If your ownCloud server is not connected to any external storage services, it is better to use other encryption tools, such as file-level or whole-disk encryption.

[CAUTION]
====
SSL terminates at or before the webserver on the ownCloud server.
Consequently, all files are in an unencrypted state between the SSL connection
termination and the ownCloud code that encrypts and decrypts them.
This is, potentially, exploitable by anyone with administrator access to your server.

== Before Enabling Encryption

Plan very carefully before enabling encryption, because it is not
reversible via the ownCloud Web interface. If you lose your encryption
keys, your files are *not* recoverable. Always have backups of your
encryption keys stored in a safe location, and consider enabling all
recovery options.

You have more options via xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#encryption[the `occ` command's encryption options].

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can't manage encryption without access to the command line.
If your ownCloud installation is on a hosted environment and you don't have access to the command line, you won't be able to run xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc[occ commands].
In this case, *don't enable encryption*!

== Encrypting External Mountpoints

You and your users can encrypt individual external mount points.
You must have external storage enabled on your Admin page, and enabled for your users.
Encryption settings can be configured in the mount options for an external storage mount; see xref:configuration/files/external_storage/configuration.adoc#mount-options[Mount Options].
