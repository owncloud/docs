= Configuring Federation Sharing
:toc: right
:toclevels: 1
:page-aliases: go/admin-sharing-federated.adoc

== Introduction

Federated Cloud Sharing is managed by the Federation app. 
When you enable the Federation app you can easily and securely link file shares between ownCloud servers, in effect creating a "cloud" of ownCloud installations.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For security reasons federated sharing **strictly requires HTTPS (SSL/TLS)**.
====

IMPORTANT: We strongly recommend using HTTP for development and testing purposes. 
However, to do so, you have to set `'sharing.federation.allowHttpFallback' => true,` in **config/config.php**.

== Configuration

Follow these steps to establish a trusted connection between two servers.

. Verify that both servers have SSL certificates.
  If you open the server URL in your browser and see a lock icon on the left-hand side of the address bar, the certificate is valid.
+
.Lock icon in the address bars in Firefox, Google Chrome, and Safari.

. Verify that the `'overwrite.cli.url' => 'https://<SERVER_URL>' setting is configured to the correct URL, instead of `localhost`, in **config.php**.
. Reset the federation job in your `oc_jobs` table. 
  This job is required to get the verification token from the other server to establish a federation connection between two servers. 
  The resetting ensures that it will be executed when we run xref:configuration/server/background_jobs_configuration.adoc#cron[system:cron] later.

----
mysql -u root -e "update oc_jobs set last_run=0 where class='OCA\\Federation\\SyncJob';" owncloud;
mysql -u root -e "update oc_jobs set last_checked=0 where class='OCA\\Federation\\SyncJob';" owncloud;
----
. Navigate to **admin settings -> sharing -> Federation**
. Add **server 1** to the trusted servers on **server 2**.
. Add **server 2** to the trusted servers on **server 1**.
. Now run the cron job in your ownCloud directory (for example `/var/www/owncloud/`).
+
[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} system:cron
----
. Now the check should be green
. Sync now your users with
+
[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} dav:sync-system-addressbook
{occ-command-example-prefix} federation:sync-addressbook
----
. Configure automatic acceptance of new federated shares.
+
[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:app:set federation auto_accept_trusted --value '0'
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:app:set federatedfilesharing auto_accept_trusted --value 'yes'
----

== Working With Proxies

There are ownCloud instances that are not connected to the internet. 
They have no possibility to reach the public network. 
Therefore Federation will not work without a proxy. 

To set the `proxy` and `proxyuserpwd` configuration variables, in `config/config.php`.
`proxy` sets the proxy’s hostname, and `proxyuserpwd` sets the username and password credentials, in `username:password` format.

== Creating a New Federation Share

Follow these steps to create a new Federation share between two ownCloud servers. 
This requires no action by the user on the remote server; all it takes is a few steps on the originating server.

. Enable the Federation app.

. Then, create a federated share by entering username@serveraddress in the sharing dialog (for example `freda@https://example.com/owncloud`). When ownCloud verifies the link,
it displays it with the *(federated)* label. Click on this label to establish the link.
+

. When the link is successfully completed, you have a single share
option, and that is *can edit*.
+

+
You may disconnect the share at any time by clicking the btn:[trash can] icon.

== Federated Sharing Scanner CronJob Configuration

[IMPORTANT]
====
As part of the migration step to 10.5, before enabling the cronjob described below, make sure to remove the system cron job from your crontab that executes legacy **occ incoming-shares:poll**
====

The Federated Sharing Scanner is a background job used to scan the federated shares to ensure the integrity of the file cache.

On each run the scanner will select federated shares that satisfy these requirements:

. ensure that within a single cron run, at max [cronjob_scan_external_batch] scans will be performed out of all accepted external shares (default 100)
. a scan of that external share has not been performed within the last [cronjob_scan_external_min_scan] seconds (default 3 hours)
. the user still exists, and has been active recently, meaning logged in within the last [cronjob_scan_external_min_login] seconds (default 24 hours)
. there has been a change in the federated remote share root etag or mtime, signaling a mandatory rescan

To enable the cronjob, go to menu:Settings[Admin Settings > Federated Cloud Sharing] and enable the checkbox

image:configuration/files/sharing/federated-cloud-sharing/scan-cronjob.png[Checkbox]

Alternatively you can use the command line:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:app:set files_sharing cronjob_scan_external_enabled --value 'yes'
----

You can also configure these settings of the cronjob:

. the minimum amount of time since last login of a user so that a scan is triggered (ensures only active users get fed shares synced)

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:app:set files_sharing cronjob_scan_external_min_login --value <integer-seconds>
----

. the minimum amount of time since last scanned so that the next scan is triggered (avoid frequent scan when active collaboration)

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:app:set files_sharing cronjob_scan_external_min_scan --value <integer-seconds>
----

. the maximum number of federated share scans per 10 minutes (scan performed only if fed share files got updated)

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:app:set files_sharing cronjob_scan_external_batch --value <integer-number>
----

Use the following command to force a run of the scanner cronjob:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} background:queue:execute --force --accept-warning <id-of-fed-scanner-job>
----

== Known Issues

=== Persistent Locks Are Not Guaranteed

There is a known bug propagated persistent locks to federated instances.
If a user creates an exclusive lock on a share, no other users should be able to modify it, nor its contents, and all users should see a lock icon on the share.

However, this isn't the case.
The following functionality has been recorded:

* The user who created the lock sees the lock icon throughout the share.
* The top-level of the share for receivers shows the lock icon.
* Sub-items of the share *do not show the lock icon*.
* The share and its contents *can still be modified by all users*; specifically: 
** Sub-items *can be deleted*.
** Sub-items *can be created*.

== Tips

=== VCARD properties

It is possible to configure the VCARD properties that are searched in order to retrieve a list of federated users in the share dialog. By default, ownCloud uses CLOUD and FN properties, however this list may be configured by the admin:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:app:set dav remote_search_properties --value=CLOUD,FN,EMAIL
----

Possible options are:

* VERSION
* UID
* FN
* N
* EMAIL
* CLOUD

=== Listing Federated Shares

In case you want to see which federated shares exist on your server, you can use this command to list them.

Currently there is no ownCloud `occ` command to list federated shares, that's why you have to use these database queries to obtain the information.

Federated shares are saved in your database. 

[source,mysql]
----
sudo mysql -u <ownCloud_DB_User> -p<ownCloud_DB_Password> -h <ownCloud_DB_Host> <ownCloud_DB_Name>
----

Incoming shares can be listed with the following query:

[source,mysql]
----
select * from oc_share where share_type=6;
----

Each unique ID gives you an incoming federated share.

Outgoing shares can be listed with the following query:
(replace `cloud.example.com` with your instance URL)

[source,mysql]
----
select * from oc_share_external where remote NOT IN ('https//cloud.example.com'); 
----

Each unique ID gives you an outgoing federated share.

Exit the database console with this command:

[source,mysql]
----
quit
----
