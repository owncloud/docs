= Configuring Federation Sharing
:toc: right

== Introduction

Federated Cloud Sharing is managed by the Federation app. 
When you enable the Federation app you can easily and securely link file shares between ownCloud servers, in effect creating a "cloud" of ownCloud installations.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For security reasons federated sharing **strictly requires HTTPS (SSL/TLS)**.
====

NOTE: For testing purposes you can use `HTTP` but you have to set `'sharing.federation.allowHttpFallback' => true,` in your **config.php**.

== Configuration

Follow these steps to establish a trusted connection between two servers.

. Verify that both servers have SSL certificates.
  If you open the server URL in your browser and see a lock icon on the left-hand side of the address bar, the certificate is valid.
+
.Lock icon in the address bars in Firefox, Google Chrome, and Safari.

. Verify that the `'overwrite.cli.url' => 'https://<SERVER_URL>' setting is configured to the correct URL, instead of `localhost`, in **config.php**.
. Reset the federation job in your `oc_jobs` table. 
  This job is required to get the verification token from the other server to establish a federation connection between two servers. 
  The resetting ensures that it will be executed when we run xref:configuration/server/background_jobs_configuration.adoc#cron[cron.php] later.

mysql -u root -e "update oc_jobs set last_run=0 where class='OCA\\Federation\\SyncJob';" owncloud;
mysql -u root -e "update oc_jobs set last_checked=0 where class='OCA\\Federation\\SyncJob';" owncloud;
----
. Navigate to **admin settings -> sharing -> Federation**
. Add **server 1** to the trusted servers on **server 2**.
. Add **server 2** to the trusted servers on **server 1**.
. Now run the cron job in your ownCloud directory (for example `/var/www/owncloud/`).
+
----
sudo -u www-data php cron.php
----
. Now the check should be green
. Sync now your users with
+
----
occ dav:sync-system-addressbook
occ federation:sync-addressbook
----
. Configure automatic acceptance of new federated shares.
+
----
occ config:app:set federation auto_accept_trusted --value '0'
occ config:app:set federatedfilesharing auto_accept_trusted --value 'yes'
----

== Working With Proxies

There are ownCloud instances that are not connected to the internet. 
They have no possibility to reach the public network. 
Therefore Federation will not work without a proxy. 

To set the `proxy` and `proxyuserpwd` configuration variables, in `config/config.php`.
`proxy` sets the proxyâ€™s hostname, and `proxyuserpwd` sets the username and password credentials, in `username:password` format.

== Creating a New Federation Share

Follow these steps to create a new Federation share between two ownCloud servers. 
This requires no action by the user on the remote server; all it takes is a few steps on the originating server.

. Enable the Federation app.

. Then, create a federated share by entering username@serveraddress in the sharing dialog (for example `freda@https://example.com/owncloud`). When ownCloud verifies the link,
it displays it with the *(remote)* label. Click on this label to establish the link.

. When the link is successfully completed, you have a single share
option, and that is *can edit*.

You may disconnect the share at any time by clicking the btn:[trash can] icon.
