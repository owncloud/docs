Use this backend to mount a directory from any WebDAV server, or another ownCloud server.

You need the following information:

* The name of your local mountpoint. 
  Optionally, a `Remote Subfolder` can be specified to change the destination directory. 
  The default is to use the whole root.
* The URL of the WebDAV or ownCloud server.
* The username and password for the remote server.

TIP: We always recommend `https://` for security reasons, so encourage you to enable btn:[Secure https://].

NOTE: CPanel users should install {web-disk-url}[Web Disk] to enable WebDAV functionality.
