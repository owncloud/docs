== Introduction

ownCloud can connect to Windows file servers, and other SMB-compatible servers (e.g.,
{samba-url}[Samba]), by using the {smbcifs-url}[SMB/CIFS] backend.

== Dependencies

To connect ownCloud to an SMB file server, you need to prepare your server. Please see the
xref:installation/manual_installation/index.adoc[Manual Installation on Linux] guides for more
information, prerequisites and requirements.

== Access Testing

To ensure that you can connect to your file server with SMB, do a small test upfront like the following.

[source,console]
----
sudo smbclient -L <file_server_name> -U <full_domain_name>/<user_name>
----

Please fix any issues before you connect ownCloud to a SMB file server.

== Configuration

When configuring ownCloud, you will need the following information:

* The folder name, which will be your local mount point.
* The URL of the Samba server.
* The username or domain/username used to login to the Samba server.
* The password to login to the Samba server.
* The share name to mount on the remote Samba server.
* The remote subfolder inside the remote Samba share to mount. This is optional, as it defaults to `/`.
+
TIP: To assign the ownCloud logon username automatically to the subfolder, use `$user` instead of a
subfolder name. The foldername=username must be present and is not created on access.
* The ownCloud users and groups who get access to the share.

[TIP]
====
Optionally, you can specify a `Domain`. This is useful in cases where the SMB server requires a
domain and a username, and an advanced authentication mechanism like Active Directory (AD), or
when using session credentials where the username cannot be modified. This is concatenated with
the username, so the backend gets `domain\username`
