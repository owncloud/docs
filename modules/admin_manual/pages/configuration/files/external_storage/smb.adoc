ownCloud can connect to Windows file servers, and other SMB-compatible servers (e.g., {samba-url}[Samba]), by using the {smbcifs-url}[SMB/CIFS] backend.

== Dependencies

There are two dependencies to connect to your ownCloud installation to Windows file servers, 

. xref:libsmbclient-php-or-smbclient[libsmbclient-php or smbclient]
. xref:the-samba-client[The Samba Client]

=== libsmbclient-php or smbclient

ownCloud's SMB/CIFS backend requires either {libsmbclientphp-url}[the libsmbclient-php module] (version 0.8.0+) or {smbclient-url}[the smbclient command] (and its dependencies) to be installed on the ownCloud server. 
We highly recommend `libsmbclient-php`, but it isn't required. 
If it is installed smbclient won't be needed. 
Most Linux distributions provide `libsmbclient-php` and typically name it `php-smbclient`.

=== The Samba Client

The Samba client must be installed on your Linux system. 
It is included in all Linux distributions; on _Debian_, _Ubuntu_, and other Debian
derivatives this is `smbclient`. 
On _SUSE_, _Red Hat_, _CentOS_, and other Red Hat derivatives it is `samba-client`. 
You also need `which` and `stdbuf`, which should be included in most Linux distributions.

== Configuration

When configuring it, you will need the following information:

* The folder name, which will be your local mount point.
* The URL of the Samba server.
* The username or domain/username used to login to the Samba server.
* The password to login to the Samba server.
* The share name to mount on the remote Samba server.
* The remote subfolder inside the remote Samba share to mount. This is optional, as it defaults to `/`.
+
TIP: To assign the ownCloud logon username automatically to the subfolder, use `$user` instead of a subfolder name.
* The ownCloud users and groups who get access to the share.

[TIP]
====
Optionally, you can specify a `Domain`. 
This is useful in cases where the SMB server requires a domain and a username, and an advanced authentication mechanism like Active Directory (AD), or when using session credentials where the username cannot be modified. 
This is concatenated with the username, so the backend gets `domain\username`
