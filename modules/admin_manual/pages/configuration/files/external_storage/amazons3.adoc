== Introduction

Amazon S3 is used to connect owncloud to your Amazon S3 bucket.

ifdef::current-server-version[]
ifeval::[{current-server-version} >= 10.3]
[IMPORTANT]
====
If your installation uses S3 as an external storage in any version before ownCloud 10.3, you have to install and enable {files_external_s3-url}[files_external_s3]. 
Otherwise, files stored on existing S3 external storages will *not* be fully accessible.
====

endif::current-server-version[]

== Configuration

To connect your Amazon S3 buckets to ownCloud, you will need:

* S3 access key
* S3 secret key
* Bucket name

In the *Folder name* field enter a local folder name for your S3 mountpoint. If it does not exist, it will be created.

In the *Available for* field, enter the users or groups who have permission to access your S3 mount.

The `Enable SSL` checkbox enables HTTPS connections; using HTTPS is always highly recommended.

Optionally, you can override the hostname, port and region of your S3 server, which is required for non-Amazon servers such as Ceph Object Gateway.

*Enable path style* is usually not required (and is, in fact, incompatible with newer Amazon datacenters), but can be used with non-Amazon servers where the DNS infrastructure cannot be controlled. Ordinarily, requests will be made with
`\http://bucket.hostname.domain/`, but with path style enabled, requests are made with
`\http://hostname.domain/bucket` instead.

xref:configuration/files/external_storage/configuration.adoc[External Storage Configuration]
for additional mount options and information, and
