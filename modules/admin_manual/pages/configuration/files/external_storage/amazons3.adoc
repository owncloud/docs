[IMPORTANT]
====
If your installation uses S3 as an external storage in any version before 10.3, you have to install and enable {files_external_s3-url}[files_external_s3]. 
Otherwise, files stored on existing S3 external storages will *not* be fully accessible.

To connect your Amazon S3 buckets to ownCloud, you will need:

* S3 access key
* S3 secret key
* Bucket name

In the *Folder name* field enter a local folder name for your S3
mountpoint. If this does not exist it will be created.

In the *Available for* field enter the users or groups who have
permission to access your S3 mount.

The `Enable SSL` checkbox enables HTTPS connections; using HTTPS is
always highly-recommended.

Optionally, you can override the hostname, port and region of your S3
server, which is required for non-Amazon servers such as Ceph Object Gateway.

*Enable path style* is usually not required (and is, in fact,
incompatible with newer Amazon datacenters), but can be used with
non-Amazon servers where the DNS infrastructure cannot be controlled.
Ordinarily, requests will be made with
`\http://bucket.hostname.domain/`, but with path style enabled, requests are made with
`\http://hostname.domain/bucket` instead.

See xref:configuration/files/external_storage_configuration_gui.adoc[External Storage Configuration]
for additional mount options and information.

See auth_mechanisms for more information on authentication schemes.
