= OpenStack Object Storage

OpenStack Object Storage is used to connect to an OpenStack Swift server, or to Rackspace. 
Two authentication mechanisms are available: one is the generic OpenStack mechanism, and the other is used exclusively for Rackspace, a provider of object storage that uses the OpenStack Swift protocol.

The OpenStack authentication mechanism uses the OpenStack Keystone v2 protocol. 
Your ownCloud configuration needs:

* *Bucket*. This is user-defined; think of it as a subdirectory of your total storage. 
  The bucket will be created if it does not exist.
* *Username* of your account.
* *Password* of your account.
* *Tenant name* of your account. (A tenant is similar to a user group.)
* *Identity Endpoint URL*, the URL to log in to your OpenStack account.

The Rackspace authentication mechanism requires:

* *Bucket*
* *Username*
* *API key*.

You must also enter the term *cloudFiles* in the *Service name* field.

It may be necessary to specify a *Region*. 
Your region should be named in your account information, and you can read about Rackspace regions at https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/about-regions/[About Regions].

The timeout of HTTP requests is set in the *Request timeout* field, in seconds.
