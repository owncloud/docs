= External Storage Authentication Mechanisms
:toc: right

== Introduction

ownCloud storage backends accept one or more authentication schemes such
as passwords, OAuth, or token-based, to name a few examples. Each
authentication scheme may be implemented by multiple authentication
mechanisms. Different mechanisms require different configuration
parameters, depending on their behaviour.

== Special Mechanisms

The *None* authentication mechanism requires no configuration
parameters, and is used when a backend requires no authentication.

The *Built-in* authentication mechanism itself requires no configuration
parameters, but is used as a placeholder for legacy storages that have
not been migrated to the new system and do not take advantage of generic
authentication mechanisms. The authentication parameters are provided
directly by the backend.

== Password-based Mechanisms

The *Username and password* mechanism requires a manually-defined
username and password. These get passed directly to the backend.

The *Log-in credentials, save in session* mechanism uses the ownCloud
login credentials of the user to connect to the storage. These are not
stored anywhere on the server, but rather in the user session, giving
increased security. The drawbacks are that sharing is disabled when this
mechanism is in use, as ownCloud has no access to the storage
credentials, and background file scanning does not work.

NOTE: here is a workaround that allows background file scanning when using *Log-in credentials, save in session*, and that is using xref:configuration/server/background_jobs_configuration.adoc[Ajax cron mode].
Be aware that the Ajax cron mode is triggered by browsing the ownCloud Web GUI.

=== Known Limitations

Please be aware that any operations must be performed by the logged-in mount owner, as credentials are not stored anywhere.
As a result, there are three known limitations, for both admin and personal mounts where both have the "_log-in credentials, save in session_" option.

These are:

. Directly sharing the storage or any of its sub-folders will go through, but the recipient will not see the share mounted. This is because the mount cannot be set up due to missing credentials. Federated sharing is also affected, because it works on a "_public link share token_" basis, which itself doesn't contain the user's storage password. As a result, the storage cannot be mounted in this case either.
. Any background task operating on the storage, such as background scanning.
. Any xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc[occ command] that operates on the storage, such as `occ files:scan`, will have no effect.

NOTE: **Enterprise Users Only** +
The enterprise version has a mode called "**Save in DB**" where the credentials are saved, in encrypted form, in the database (via xref:enterprise/external_storage/windows-network-drive_configuration.adoc[the WND app]). In this mode, all of the above operations work.

== Public-key Mechanisms

Currently only the RSA mechanism is implemented, where a public/private
keypair is generated by ownCloud and the public half shown in the GUI.
The keys are generated in the SSH format, and are currently 1024 bits in
length. Keys can be regenerated with a button in the GUI.

== OAuth

OAuth 1.0 and OAuth 2.0 are both implemented, but currently limited to
the Dropbox and Google Drive backends respectively. These mechanisms
require additional configuration at the service provider, where an app
ID and app secret are provided and then entered into ownCloud. Then
ownCloud can perform an authentication request, establishing the storage
connection.

If ownCloud clientâ€™s are unable to connect to your ownCloud server,
check that the bearer authorization header xref:configuration/general_topics/general_troubleshooting.adoc#owncloud-clients-cannot-connect-to-the-owncloud-server[is not being stripped out].
