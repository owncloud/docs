= Local

Local storage provides the ability to mount any directory on your ownCloud server that is:

* Outside of your ownCloud `data/` directory
* Both readable and writable by your HTTP server user

Since this is a significant security risk, Local storage is only configurable via the ownCloud admin settings. 
Non-admin users cannot create Local storage mounts.

See
xref:installation/manual_installation.adoc#set-strong-directory-permissions[Set Strong Directory Permissions]
for information on correct file permissions, and find your HTTP user
xref:configuration/general_topics/general_troubleshooting.adoc#php-version-and-information[PHP Version and Information].

To manage Local storage, navigate to `admin`, and then to `Storage`.
You can see an example in the screenshot below.

In the *Folder name* field enter the folder name that you want to appear on your ownCloud Files page. 
In the *Configuration* field enter the full file path of the directory you want to mount. 
In the *Available for* field enter the users or groups who have permission to access the mount; by default all users have access.

In addition to these steps, you have to ensure that Local storage is enabled in your ownCloud installationâ€™s `config/config.php` file. 
It should have the following configuration:

[source,php]
----
'files_external_allow_create_new_local' => 'true',
----

See
xref:configuration/files/external_storage_configuration_gui.adoc[Configuring External Storage (GUI)]
for additional mount options and information, and
xref:configuration/files/external_storage/auth_mechanisms.adoc[External Storage Authentication mechanisms]
for more information on authentication schemes.
