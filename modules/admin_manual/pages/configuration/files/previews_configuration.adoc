= Previews Configuration
:toc: right

== Introduction

The ownCloud thumbnail system generates previews of files for all
ownCloud apps that display files, such as Files.

The following image shows some examples of previews of various file types.

By default, ownCloud can generate previews for the following filetypes:

* Images files
* Cover of MP3 files
* Text documents

NOTE: Older versions of ownCloud also supported the preview generation of other file types such as PDF, SVG or various office documents. Due to security concerns those providers have been disabled by default and are considered unsupported. While those providers are still available, we discourage enabling them, and they are not documented.

== Parameters

Please notice that the ownCloud preview system comes already with
sensible defaults, and therefore it is usually unnecessary to adjust
those configuration values. If you want to configure previews, add
or change the following parameters in `config/config.php`. 


=== Disabling previews

Under certain circumstances, for example if the server has limited
resources, you might want to consider disabling the generation of
previews. Note that if you do this all previews in all apps are
disabled and will display generic icons instead of thumbnails.

Set the configuration option `enable_previews` to `false`:

----
  'enable_previews' => false,
----

=== Maximum preview size

There are two configuration options for setting the maximum size (in
pixels) of a preview. These are `preview_max_x` which represents the
x-axis and `preview_max_y` which represents the y-axis. The default
value you can reference in `config/config.sample.php` is set to 2048.

The following example would limit previews to a maximum size of 100 px Ã— 100 px:

----
  'preview_max_x' => 100,
  'preview_max_y' => 100,
----

NOTE: If you want no limit applied for one or both of these values then set them to `null`.

=== Maximum scale factor

If a lot of small pictures are stored on the ownCloud instance and the
preview system generates blurry previews, you might want to consider
setting a maximum scale factor. By default, pictures are upscaled to 10
times the original size:

----
  'preview_max_scale_factor' => 10,
----

If you want to disable scaling at all, you can set the config value to `1':

----
  'preview_max_scale_factor' => 1,
----

If you want to disable the maximum scaling factor, you can set the config value to `null`:

----
  'preview_max_scale_factor' => null,
----
