= Controlling File Versions

== How Versions are Created

Every time when a file gets rewritten to the storage, the versions app
(`files_versions`) creates a new backup copy of the file. These backups are
stored inside a folder `files_versions` which is inside the users root folder.
The app will add the suffix `.v` followed by the unix timestamp of the creation
date of the backup copy.

.
├── files
│   └── welcome.txt
└── files_versions
    ├── welcome.txt.v1556203470
    ├── welcome.txt.v1556203501
    └── welcome.txt.v1556203567
....

NOTE: File versioning only gets triggered if the change is made via the
ownCloud ecosystem. It does not get triggered if the change is made at a
mounted filesystem directly.

Versions are displayed in the WebUI in the details view in the right sidebar if
you click on the file row in the file listing. You can restore the current file
to one of the earlier backup copies in the list, by clicking on the btn:[restore] icon
of the specific version.

== How Versions are Deleted

The versions app deletes old file versions
automatically to ensure that users do not exceed their storage quotas.
This is done by automatic background jobs which clean up the versions following
a specific pattern. This pattern defines the expiration date for each backup version.

=== Default Versions Delete Patterns

This is the default pattern used to delete old versions:

* For the last second we keep one version
* For the last 10 seconds ownCloud keeps one version every 2 seconds
* For the last minute ownCloud keeps one version every 10 seconds
* For the last hour ownCloud keeps one version every minute
* For the last 24 hours ownCloud keeps one version every hour
* For the last 30 days ownCloud keeps one version every day
* If the versions are older than 30 days ownCloud keeps one version every week

The versions are adjusted along this pattern every time a new version is
created and the background job was executed.

==== Example

[cols="2,3", options="header"]
|===
|Time Period before last Expiration
|Maximum Number of Versions:

|1 second
|1

|10 seconds
|5

| 1 minute
| 6

| 1 hour
| 59

| 1 day
| 23

| 30 days
| 30
|===

WARNING: The versions app never uses more that 50% of the user’s storage quota.
If the stored versions exceed this limit, ownCloud deletes the oldest
file versions until it meets the disk space limit again.

TIP: Adjust the `'versions_retention_obligation'` setting in `config.php` to avoid
filling up the user's quota.

== Change the Expiration Settings

You may alter the default pattern in `config.php`. The default setting
is `auto`, which sets the default pattern:

[source,php]
----
'versions_retention_obligation' => 'auto',
----

=== Possible Config Values

[cols="1a,3"]
|===
|`D, auto`
|Keep versions at least for D days, apply expiration rules to all versions that are older than D days

|`auto, D`
|Delete all versions that are older than D days automatically, delete other versions according to expiration rules

|`D1, D2`
|Keep versions for at least `D1` days and delete when they exceed `D2` days.

|`disabled`
|Disable Versions; no files will be deleted.
|===

==== Example 1:

Keep all versions for at least 10 days, apply expiration rules to all versions that are older than 10 days.
This will keep a lot more versions during the last 10 days compared to the default pattern.

[source,php]
----
'versions_retention_obligation' => '10, auto',
----

==== Example 2:

Apply expiration rules to all versions that are created during the last 30 days and do not keep any versions older than 30 days.

[source,php]
----
'versions_retention_obligation' => 'auto, 30',
----

==== Example 3:

Do not apply any expiration rules. Delete all versions after 30 days.

[source,php]
----
'versions_retention_obligation' => '30, 30',
----

== Enterprise File Retention

Enterprise customers have additional tools for managing file retention policies; see xref:enterprise/file_management/files_tagging.adoc[Advanced File Tagging With the Workflow App].
