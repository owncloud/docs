= Backing up ownCloud
:toc: right

When you backup your ownCloud server, there are four things that you need to copy:

1.  Your `config/` directory.
2.  Your `data/` directory.
3.  Your ownCloud database.
4.  Your custom theme files, if you have any. (See xref:developer_manual:core/theming.adoc[Theming ownCloud])

When you install your ownCloud server from our
https://download.owncloud.org/download/repositories/stable/owncloud/[Open
Build Service] packages (or from distro packages, which we do not
recommend) *do not backup your ownCloud server files*, which are the
other files in your `owncloud/` directory such as `core/`, `3rdparty/`,
`apps/`, `lib/`, and all the rest of the ownCloud files. If you restore
these files from backup they may not be in sync with the current package
versions, and will fail the code integrity check. This may also cause
other errors, such as white pages.

When you install ownCloud from the source tarballs this will not be an
issue, and you can safely backup your entire ownCloud installation, with
the exception of your ownCloud database. Databases cannot be copied, but
you must use the database tools to make a correct database dump.

To restore your ownCloud installation from backup, see xref:maintenance/restore.adoc[Restoring ownCloud].

== Backing Up the config/ and data/ Directories

Simply copy your `config/` and `data/` folder to a place outside of your
ownCloud environment. This example uses `rsync` to copy the two
directories to `/oc-backupdir`:

----
rsync -Aax config data /oc-backupdir/
----

There are many ways to backup normal files, and you may use whatever
method you are accustomed to.

== Backup Database

You can't just copy a database, but must use the database tools to make
a correct database dump.

=== MySQL/MariaDB

MySQL or MariaDB, which is a drop-in MySQL replacement, is the
recommended database engine. To backup MySQL/MariaDB:

[source,console]
----
mysqldump --single-transaction -h [server] -u [username] -p [password] [db_name] > owncloud-dbbackup_`date +"%Y%m%d"`.bak
----

Example:

[source,console]
----
mysqldump --single-transaction -h localhost -u username -p password owncloud > owncloud-dbbackup_`date +"%Y%m%d"`.bak
----

=== SQLite

[source,console]
----
sqlite3 data/owncloud.db .dump > owncloud-dbbackup_`date +"%Y%m%d"`.bak
----

=== PostgreSQL

[source,postgresql]
----
PGPASSWORD="password" pg_dump [db_name] -h [server] -U [username] -f owncloud-dbbackup_`date +"%Y%m%d"`.bak
----

== Restoring Files From Backup When Encryption Is Enabled

If you need to restore files from backup, which were backed up when
encryption was enabled, here's how to do it.

WARNING: This is *not officially supported*. ownCloud officially supports either restoring the full backup or restoring nothing â€” not restoring individual parts of it.

* Restore the file from backup.
* Restore the file's encryption keys from your backup.
* Run `occ files:scan`, which makes the scanner find it.

[NOTE]
====
In the DB it will:

- Have the "size" set to the encrypted size, which is wrong (and bigger);
- The "encrypted" flag will be set to 0
====

* xref:retrieve-encrypted-flag-value[Retrieve the encrypted flag value]
* Update the encrypted flag.

NOTE: There's no need to update the encrypted flag for files in either `files_versions` or `files_trashbin`,
because these aren't scanned or found by `occ files:scan`.

* Download the file once as the user; the file's size will be corrected automatically.

This process might not be suitable across all environments.
If it's not suitable for yours, you might need to run an OCC command that does the scanning.

=== Retrieve the Encrypted Flag Value

1. In the backup database, retrieve the `numeric_id` value for https://github.com/owncloud/core/wiki/Storage-IDs[the storage]
   where the file was located from the `oc_storages` table and store the value
   for later reference.
   For example, if you have the following in your `oc_storages` table, then
   `numeric_id` you should use is `3`, if you need to restore a file for `user1`.

   +--------------------------------+------------+-----------+--------------+
   | id                             | numeric_id | available | last_checked |
   +--------------------------------+------------+-----------+--------------+
   | home::admin                    |          1 |         1 |         NULL |
   | local::/var/www/owncloud/data/ |          2 |         1 |         NULL |
   | home::user1                    |          3 |         1 |         NULL |
   +--------------------------------+------------+-----------+--------------+

2. In the live database instance, find the `fileid` of the file to restore by
   running the query below, substituting the placeholders for the retrieved
   values, and store the value for later reference.

   SELECT fileid
   FROM oc_filecache
   WHERE path = 'path/to/the/file/to/restore'
     AND storage = <numeric_id>

3. Retrieve the backup, which includes the data folder and database.

4. Retrieve the required file from your backup and copy it to the real instance.

5. In the backup database, retrieve the file's `encrypted` value, by running
   the query below and store the value for later reference.
   The example query assumes the storage was the same and the file was in the same location.
   If not, you will need to track down where the file was before.

   SELECT encrypted
   FROM oc_filecache
   WHERE path = 'path/to/the/file/to/restore'
     AND storage = <numeric_id>

6. Update the live database instance with retrieved information, by running the
   following query, substituting the placeholders for the retrieved values:

   UPDATE oc_filecache
     SET encrypted = <encrypted>
     WHERE fileid = <fileid>.
