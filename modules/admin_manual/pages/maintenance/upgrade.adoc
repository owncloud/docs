= How to Upgrade Your ownCloud Server
:toc: right

== Introduction

We recommend that you keep your ownCloud server up to date. When an
update is available for your ownCloud server, you will see a
notification at the top of your ownCloud Web interface. When you click
the notification, it will bring you here.

Before beginning an upgrade, please keep the following points in mind:

* Review xref:release_notes.adoc[the release notes] for important information
about the needed migration steps during that upgrade to help ensure a
smooth upgrade process.
* Skipping major releases is not supported. However _you can_ migrate
from 9.0.9 straight to 10.0.
* Downgrading is not supported.
* Upgrading is disruptive, as your ownCloud server will be put into
xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#maintenance-commands[maintenance mode].
* Large installations may take several hours to complete the upgrade.
* Downgrading *is not supported* as it risks corrupting your data. If
you want to revert to an older ownCloud version, make a new, fresh
installation and then restore your data from backup. Before doing this,
file a support ticket (if you have paid support) or ask for help in the
ownCloud forums to resolve your issue without downgrading.

[[prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

We strongly recommend that you always maintain xref:maintenance/backup.adoc[regular backups]
as well as make a fresh backup before every upgrade. We also recommend
that you review any installed third-party apps for compatibility with
the new ownCloud release. Ensure that they are all disabled before
beginning the upgrade. After the upgrade is complete re-enable any which
are compatible with the new release.

CAUTION: Install unsupported apps at your own risk.

[[upgrade-options]]
== Upgrade Options

There are three ways to upgrade your ownCloud server:

1.  *(Recommended)* Perform a xref:maintenance/manual_upgrade.adoc[manual upgrade], using 
http://owncloud.org/install/[the latest ownCloud release].
2.  Use xref:maintenance/package_upgrade.adoc[your distributionâ€™s package manager], 
in conjunction with our official ownCloud repositories. *Note:* This approach should not be used unattended 
nor in clustered setups.
3.  Use xref:maintenance/update.adoc[the Updater App]. This is needed in scenarios where the admin does 
not have access to the command line. It is recommended for shared hosting environments and for users who 
want an easy way to track different release channels.

NOTE: Enterprise customers will use their Enterprise software repositories to maintain their ownCloud servers, rather than the Open Build Service. Please see xref:enterprise/installation/install.adoc[Installing & Upgrading ownCloud Enterprise Edition] for more information.
