= Upgrade ownCloud From Packages
:toc: right

[[upgrade-quickstart]]
== Upgrade Quickstart

The alternative to a manual upgrade is configuring your system to use ownCloud’s
https://download.owncloud.org/download/repositories/stable/owncloud/[Open Build Service] repository.
Then stay current by using your Linux package manager to install fresh ownCloud packages. 
After installing upgraded packages you must run a few more steps to complete the upgrade. 
These are the basic steps to upgrading ownCloud:

* Disable all xref:maintenance/manual_upgrade.adoc#review-third-party-apps[third-party apps].
* Make xref:maintenance/backup.adoc[a fresh backup].
* Upgrade your ownCloud packages.
* Run xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#command-line-upgrade[occ upgrade]
+
NOTE: The optional parameter to skip migration tests was removed in ownCloud 10.0. See xref:maintenance/upgrade.adoc[Testing a Migration] for background information.

* Apply xref:installation/manual_installation.adoc#set-strong-directory-permissions[strong permissions] to your ownCloud directories.
* Take your ownCloud server out of xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#maintenance-commands[maintenance mode].
* Re-enable third-party apps.

IMPORTANT: When upgrading from oC 9.0 to 9.1 with existing Calendars or Address books please have a look at 
the xref:release_notes.adoc#changes-in-9-1[release notes] for important information about the needed 
migration steps during that upgrade.

[[upgrade-tips]]
== Upgrade Tips

Upgrading ownCloud from our
https://download.owncloud.org/download/repositories/stable/owncloud/[Open Build Service]
repository is just like any normal Linux upgrade. For example, on Debian or Ubuntu Linux this is the 
standard system upgrade command:

----
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
----

Or you can upgrade just ownCloud with this command:

----
apt-get update && apt-get install owncloud-files
----

On Fedora, CentOS, and Red Hat Linux use `yum` to see all available
updates:

----
yum check-update
----

You can apply all available updates with this command:

----
yum update
----

Or update only ownCloud:

----
yum update owncloud-files
----

Your Linux package manager only downloads the current ownCloud packages.
Then your ownCloud server is immediately put into maintenance mode. You
may not see this until you refresh your ownCloud page.

Then use `occ` to complete the upgrade. You must run `occ` as your HTTP
user. This example is for Debian/Ubuntu:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} upgrade
----

This example is for CentOS/RHEL/Fedora:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} upgrade
----

The optional parameter to skip migration tests during this step was removed in ownCloud 10.0.

TIP: See xref:maintenance/manual_upgrade.adoc#test-the-upgrade[Testing a Migration] for background
information, and xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc[Using the OCC command] to learn more about `occ`.

[[setting-strong-directory-permissions]]
== Setting Strong Directory Permissions

After upgrading, verify that your ownCloud
xref:installation/manual_installation.adoc#set-strong-directory-permissions[directory permissions are set] accordingly.

[[upgrading-across-skipped-releases]]
== Upgrading Across Skipped Releases

It is best to update your ownCloud installation with every new point
release (e.g., 8.1.10), and to never skip any major release (e.g., don’t
skip 8.2.x between 8.1.x and 9.0.x). If you have skipped any major
release you can bring your ownCloud current with these steps:

1.  Add the repository of your current version (e.g., 8.1.x)
2.  Upgrade your current version to the latest point release (e.g., 8.1.10) via your package manager
3.  Run the `occ upgrade` routine (see xref:upgrade-quickstart[Upgrade Quickstart] above)
4.  Add the repository of the next major release (e.g., 8.2.x)
5.  Upgrade your current version to the next major release (e.g., 8.2.8) via your package manager
6.  Run the `occ upgrade` routine (see xref:upgrade-quickstart[Upgrade Quickstart] above)
7.  Repeat from step 4 until you reach the last available major release (e.g., 9.1.x)

You’ll find repositories of previous ownCloud major releases in the 
https://owncloud.org/changelog/[ownCloud Server Changelog].
