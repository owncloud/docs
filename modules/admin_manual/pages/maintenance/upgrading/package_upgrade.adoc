== Upgrade Steps

The alternative to a manual upgrade is add the {oc-install-package-url}[ownCloud package repository] to your system's installation sources. Then stay current by using your Linux package manager to install fresh ownCloud packages. However, you should exclude the ownCloud package during system upgrades. For more information, check out the section on xref:installation/linux_packetmanager_install.adoc[Linux Package Manager Installation]

IMPORTANT: This approach should not be used unattended nor in clustered setups.

In general, we discourage upgrades with a Linux package manager because you might encounter unwanted side effects and you'll have to manage the PHP installation separately. For further information on upgrading PHP, see section xref:installation/manual_installation/manual_installation.adoc#prepare-your-server[Prepare Your Server]

If you want to proceed anyway, read the xref:ROOT:server_release_notes.adoc[release notes] for important information first.

Before installing upgraded packages, perform the following steps: 

* Disable all xref:maintenance/manual_upgrade.adoc#review-third-party-apps[third-party apps].
* Make xref:maintenance/backup_and_restore/backup.adoc[a fresh backup].

Now you can upgrade your ownCloud packages, then run +
xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#command-line-upgrade[{occ-command-example-prefix} upgrade].

NOTE: The optional parameter to skip migration tests was removed in ownCloud 10.0. See xref:maintenance/upgrade.adoc[Testing a Migration] for background information.

After the upgrade is finished, perform the following actions:

* Apply xref:installation/manual_installation/manual_installation.adoc#script-guided-installation[Set Correct Permissions] to your ownCloud directories.
* Take your ownCloud server out of xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#maintenance-commands[maintenance mode].
* Re-enable third-party apps.

IMPORTANT: When upgrading from oC 9.0 to 9.1 with existing Calendars or Address books please have a look at the
xref:ROOT:server_release_notes.adoc#changes-in-9-1[release notes] for important information about the needed migration steps during that upgrade.

== Upgrading Only ownCloud or the Complete System

Upgrading ownCloud from our {oc-install-package-url}[package repositories] works like any normal Linux upgrade. For example, on Debian or Ubuntu Linux the standard system upgrade command is:

[source,console]
----
sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
----

Or you can upgrade just ownCloud with this command:

[source,console]
----
sudo apt-get update && apt-get install owncloud-files
----

On Fedora, CentOS, and Red Hat Linux use `yum` to see all available
updates:

[source,console]
----
sudo yum check-update
----

You can apply all available updates with this command:

[source,console]
----
sudo yum update
----

Or update only ownCloud:

[source,console]
----
sudo yum update owncloud-files
----

Your Linux package manager only downloads the current ownCloud packages. Then your ownCloud server is immediately put into maintenance mode. You may not see this until you refresh your ownCloud page.

Then use `occ` to complete the upgrade. You must run `occ` as your HTTP user. This example is for Debian/Ubuntu as well as CentOS/RHEL/Fedora:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} upgrade
----

The optional parameter to skip migration tests during this step was removed in ownCloud 10.0.

== Setting Strong Directory Permissions

After upgrading, verify that for your ownCloud the
xref:installation/manual_installation/manual_installation.adoc#script-guided-installation[correct permissions] are set.

== Upgrading Across Skipped Releases

It is best to update your ownCloud installation with every new point release (e.g., 8.1.10) and to never skip any major release (e.g., donâ€™t skip 8.2.x between 8.1.x and 9.0.x). If you have skipped any major release, you should upgrade your ownCloud step by step:

1.  Add the repository of your current version (e.g., 8.1.x)
2.  Upgrade your current version to the latest point release (e.g., 8.1.10) via your package manager
3.  Run the `occ upgrade` routine
4.  Add the repository of the next major release (e.g., 8.2.x)
5.  Upgrade your current version to the next major release (e.g., 8.2.8) via your package manager
6.  Run the `occ upgrade` routine
7.  Repeat from step 4 until you reach the last available major release (e.g., 9.1.x)
