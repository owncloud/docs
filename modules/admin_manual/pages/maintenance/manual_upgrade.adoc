= Manual ownCloud Upgrade
:toc: right

== Introduction

This section describes how to manually upgrade your ownCloud installation.

If you’re not comfortable performing a manual upgrade, you can also use your Linux distribution’s
xref:installation/linux_installation.adoc[package manager].

[[backup-your-existing-installation]]
== Backup Your Existing Installation

First, xref:maintenance/backup.adoc[backup] the following items:

* The ownCloud server data directory
* The `config.php` file
* All 3rd party apps
* The ownCloud server database

[source,console]
----
# This example assumes Ubuntu Linux and MariaDB
cp -rv /var/www/owncloud /opt/backup/owncloud && mysqldump <db_name> > /opt/backup/backup-file.sql
----

[[review-third-party-apps]]
== Review Third-Party Apps

Review any installed third-party apps for compatibility with the new ownCloud release. 
You can find a list of all third-party apps by running the following command, from the root directory of your installation.

[source,console]
----
sudo -u www-data php occ app:list --shipped=false
----

Ensure that they are all disabled before beginning the upgrade. 
After the upgrade is complete, re-enable any apps that are compatible with the new release.

WARNING: Install unsupported apps at your own risk.

[[check-ownclouds-mandatory-requirements]]
== Check ownCloud’s Mandatory Requirements

ownCloud's xref:installation/manual_installation#requirements[mandatory requirements] (such as PHP versions and extensions) can change from one version to the next.
Ensure that you review them and update your server(s), if required, before upgrading ownCloud.

[[enable-maintenance-mode]]
== Enable Maintenance Mode

Put your server in xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#maintenance-commands[maintenance mode] and disable xref:configuration/server/background_jobs_configuration.adoc#cron-jobs[Cron jobs].
Doing so prevents new logins, locks the sessions of logged-in users, and displays a status screen so that users know what is happening.

There are two ways to enable maintenance mode.
The preferred method is to use xref:configuration/server/occ_command#maintenance-commands[the occ command] — which you must run as your webserver user.
The other way is by entering your `config.php` file and changing `'maintenance' => false,` to `'maintenance' => true,`.

[source,console]
----
# Enable maintenance mode using the occ command.
sudo -u www-data php occ maintenance:mode --on

# Disable Cron jobs
sudo service cron stop
----

[[stop-the-webserver]]
== Stop the Webserver

With those steps completed, stop your webserver.

[source,console]
----
sudo service apache2 stop
----

[[download-the-latest-installation]]
== Download the Latest Installation

Download the latest ownCloud server release from https://owncloud.org/install/[owncloud.org/install/] into an empty directory *outside* of your current installation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Once you have done that, ensure that the downloaded archive xref:maintenance/update.adoc#setting-permissions-for-updating[is owned by the web user and that the correct permissions are set].
====

NOTE: Enterprise users must download their new ownCloud archives from their accounts on
https://customer.owncloud.com/owncloud/.

[[setup-the-new-installation]]
== Setup the New Installation

Not all installations are the same, so we encourage you to take one of
two paths to upgrade your ownCloud installation. These are
the standard upgrade and the power user upgrade.

If you’re reasonably new to ownCloud, or not too familiar with upgrading
an ownCloud installation, please follow the standard upgrade. Otherwise,
take the approach that you’re most comfortable with, likely the power
user upgrade.

NOTE: Regardless of which approach that you take, they will both assume that your existing ownCloud installation is located in the default location:
`/var/www/owncloud`.

[[the-standard-upgrade]]
=== The Standard Upgrade

Delete all files and folders in your existing ownCloud directory
(`/var/www/owncloud`) — *_except_* `data` and `config`.

NOTE: Don’t keep the `apps` directory.

With those files and folders deleted, extract the archive of the latest
ownCloud server, over the top of your existing installation.

[source,console]
----
# Extract the .tar.bz2 archive
tar -jxf owncloud-10.0.3.tar.bz2 -C /var/www/

# Extract the zip archive
unzip -q owncloud-10.0.3.zip -d /var/www/
----

[[the-power-user-upgrade]]
=== The Power User Upgrade

Rename your current ownCloud directory, for example, from `owncloud` to `owncloud-old`. 
Extract the unpacked ownCloud server directory and its contents to the location of your original ownCloud installation.

IMPORTANT: These steps must be run as your web server user. 
Otherwise,  you will likely encounter errors during the upgrade process, and ownCloud will likely not function correctly. 
For more information, please refer to xref:installation/manual_installation.adoc#set-strong-directory-permissions[the details on setting strong directory permissions].

[source,console]
----
# Assumes that the new release was unpacked into /tmp/
mv /tmp/owncloud /var/www/
----

With the new source files now in place of the old ones, next copy the
`config.php` file from your old ownCloud directory to your new ownCloud
directory. :

[source,console]
----
cp /var/www/owncloud-old/config/config.php /var/www/owncloud/config/config.php
----

If you keep your `data/` directory _inside_ your `owncloud/` directory, copy it from your old version of ownCloud to your new version. 
If you keep it _outside_ of your `owncloud/` directory, then you don’t have to do anything with it, because its location is configured in your original `config.php`, and none of the upgrade steps touch it.

[[market-and-marketplace-app-upgrades]]
== Market and Marketplace App Upgrades

Before getting too far into the upgrade process, please be aware of how
the Market app and its configuration options affect the upgrade process.

* The Market app is not upgraded if it is either disabled (because `appstoreenabled` is set to `false`) or it is not available.
* If `upgrade.automatic-app-update` is set to `false` apps installed from the Marketplace are not automatically upgraded.

In addition to these two points, if there are installed apps (whether
compatible or incompatible with the next version, or missing source
code) and the Market app is enabled, but there is no available internet
connection, then these apps will need to be manually updated once the
upgrade is finished.

[[start-the-upgrade]]
== Start the Upgrade

With the apps disabled and the webserver started, launch xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#command-line-upgrade[the upgrade process] from the command line:

[source,console]
----
# Here is an example on CentOS Linux
sudo -u www-data php occ upgrade
----

IMPORTANT: The optional parameter to skip migration tests during this step was removed in oC 10.0.

The upgrade operation can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours, depending on the size of your installation.
When it is finished you will see either a success message, or an error message which indicates why the process did not complete successfully.

[[copy-old-apps]]
== Copy Old Apps

If you are using third party or enterprise applications, look in your new `/var/www/owncloud/apps/` directory to see if they are there. 
If not, copy them from your old `apps/` directory to your new one, and make sure that the directory permissions are the same as for the other ones.

[[disable-maintenance-mode]]
== Disable Maintenance Mode

Assuming your upgrade succeeded, next disable maintenance mode and restart the Cron service. 
The following example shows how to do both.

[source,console]
----
# Disable maintenance mode using the occ command.
sudo -u www-data php occ maintenance:mode --off

# Restart the Cron service
sudo service cron start
----

[[restart-the-webserver]]
== Restart the Webserver

With all that done, restart your web server. :

[source,console]
----
sudo service apache2 start
----

[[finalize-the-installation]]
== Finalize the Installation

With maintenance mode disabled, login and:

* Check that the version number reflects the new installation. It’s
visible at the bottom of your Admin page.
* Check that your other settings are correct.
* Go to the Apps page and review the core apps to make sure the right ones are enabled.
* Re-enable your third-party apps.
* Apply xref:installation/manual_installation.adoc#set-strong-directory-permissions[strong permissions] to your ownCloud directories.

[[test-the-upgrade]]
== Test the Upgrade

Previous versions of ownCloud included a migration test. ownCloud first
ran a migration simulation by copying the ownCloud database and
performing the upgrade on the copy, to ensure that the migration would
succeed.

Then the copied tables were deleted after the upgrade was completed.
This doubled the upgrade time, so admins could skip this test (by
risking a failed upgrade) with `php occ upgrade --skip-migration-test`.

NOTE: The migration test was removed in ownCloud 10.0. 

ownCloud server
admins should have current backups before migration, and rely on backups
to correct any problems from the migration.

[[reverse-upgrade]]
== Reverse Upgrade

If you need to reverse your upgrade, see restore.

[[troubleshooting]]
== Troubleshooting

When upgrading ownCloud and you are running MySQL or MariaDB with binary
logging enabled, your upgrade may fail with these errors in your
MySQL/MariaDB log:

....
An unhandled exception has been thrown:
exception 'PDOException' with the message 'SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1665
Cannot execute statement: impossible to write to binary log since
BINLOG_FORMAT = STATEMENT and at least one table uses a storage engine limited to row-based logging. InnoDB is limited to row-logging when transaction isolation level is READ COMMITTED or READ UNCOMMITTED.'
....

Please refer to
xref:configuration/database/linux_database_configuration.adoc#mysql-mariadb-with-binary-logging-enabled[MySQL / MariaDB with Binary Logging Enabled]
on how to correctly configure your environment.

Occasionally, _files do not show up after an upgrade_. A rescan of the files can help:

[source,console]
----
sudo -u www-data php occ files:scan --all
----

See https://owncloud.org/support[the owncloud.org support page] for further resources for both
home and enterprise users.

Sometimes, ownCloud can get _stuck in a upgrade_.
This is usually due to the process taking too long and encountering a PHP time-out.
Stop the upgrade process this way:

[source,console]
----
sudo -u www-data php occ maintenance:mode --off
----

Then start the manual process:

[source,console]
----
sudo -u www-data php occ upgrade
----

If this does not work properly, try the repair function:

[source,console]
----
sudo -u www-data php occ maintenance:repair
----
