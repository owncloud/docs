== Standard Installation

Use these commands to install MariaDB provided by Ubuntu and secure its installation.

NOTE: At the time of writing, with Ubuntu 20.04, `mariadb-server` version `10.4.21` will be installed:

[source,console]
----
sudo apt install mariadb-server
sudo mysql_secure_installation
----

Check access and the version of MariaDB, replace `<admin_user>` as either defined during `mysql_secure_installation` above or use e.g. `root`.

[source,console]
----
sudo mysqladmin -u <admin_user> -p version
----

If you get an output like below, your database is up and running and ready to serve requests.

== Higher Stable Release

For information on how to install a higher stable release of MariaDB than the one provided by Ubuntu, refer to the {install-mariadb-latest-url}[MariaDB installation documentation].

WARNING: The installation and use of MariaDB 10.6 is *only* supported and functional with ownCloud release 10.9 or above if it is a new ownCloud installation. An upgrade from an older version of ownCloud is not supported with MariaDB 10.6.

== Upgarding an Existing Release

When upgrading from one minor version of MariaDB to another, e.g. from 10.4 to 10.5, follow the respective {upgrade-mariadb-url}[Upgrading MariaDB] guide.

WARNING: Do not upgrade a running ownCloud installation to MariaDB 10.6 until ownCloud release 10.9 is installed. ownCloud release 10.9 runs well with MariaDB lower than 10.6 and has special instructions for upgrading to MariaDB 10.6. 

WARNING: You must not skip minor releases of MariaDB when upgrading like from 10.4 -> 10.6, you have to upgrade to each minor version in between step by step.

[NOTE]
====
If you have an existing installation of MariaDB and upgrade to a higher version, do not forget to run the following command to handle the new setup for admin users â€” especially when running an older version of MariaDB and upgrading to MariaDB 10.4.3 upwards:

[source,console]
----
sudo mysql_upgrade 
----
====

== Notes For MariaDB Lower Than 10.4.3

[NOTE]
====
For MariaDB server releases lower than 10.4.3, you will be prompted during the installation to create a root password. Be sure to remember your password, as you will need it during the ownCloud database setup.
====

To install an ownCloud database, you need an administrative user who can log in, has rights to create/modify databases and users. If this user does not exist, like on MariaDB server releases higher than 10.4.3, or if you want to create a temporary user for this task, you manually have to create one. You will be asked for the mysql root user's password:

[source,console]
----
sudo mysql --user=root -p

CREATE USER 'dbadmin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'dbadmin'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
exit
----

== Notes For MariaDB Higher Than 10.4.3

[NOTE]
====
From MariaDB 10.4.3 onwards, the authentication method has changed to UNIX sockets. For details, please refer to: {auth-unix-socket-url}[MariaDB: Authentication Plugin - Unix Socket]. The unix_socket authentication plugin allows the user to use operating system credentials when connecting to MariaDB via a local UNIX socket. Follow the procedure below to create an admin user for non-socket login, giving ownCloud access to create its database for phpMyAdmin.

_This is not the ownCloud user!_ +
_Don't forget to change the username and password according to your needs_.

[source,console]
----
sudo mysql
MariaDB [(none)]>
 CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'dbadmin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
 GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'dbadmin'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
 FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
 SHOW GRANTS FOR 'dbadmin'@'localhost';
----
====

== phpmyadmin

If you want to install phpMyAdmin as a graphical interface for administering the database, run the following command:

[source,console]
----
sudo apt install phpmyadmin
----

After the installation, you need to configure your web server to access `phpmyadmin`. This is a manual task, depending on how your setup looks like and is not part of this documentation.

NOTE: You can run `sudo dpkg-reconfigure phpmyadmin` to reconfigure phpmyadmin.
