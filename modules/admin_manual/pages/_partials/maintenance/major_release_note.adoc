[TIP]
====
If required, you can skip major releases when upgrading your ownCloud installation.
However, we recommend that you first upgrade to the latest point release of your respective minor version, e.g. _8.2.11_.
See xref:maintenance/package_upgrade.adoc#upgrading-across-skipped-releases[Upgrading Across Skipped Releases] for more information.

If you are on ownCloud 8.2.11, 9.0.9 or 9.1.X, you can go directly to the latest server version.

Here are some examples:

----
8.2.11 -> Directly 10.2.1
8.2.10 -> Need 8.2.11, then 10.2.1
9.0.9 -> Directly 10.2.1
9.0.8 -> Need 9.0.9, then 10.2.1
9.1.8 -> Directly 10.2.1
9.1.0 -> Directly 10.2.1
7.0.15 -> Need then 8.0.x, then 8.1.x, 8.2.11 then directly 10.2.1
7.0.10 -> Need 7.0.15, then 8.0.x, then 8.1.x, 8.2.11 then directly 10.2.1
