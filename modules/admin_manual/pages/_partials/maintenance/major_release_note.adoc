[TIP]
====
If required, you can skip major releases when upgrading your ownCloud installation.
However, we recommend that you first upgrade to the latest point release of your respective minor version, e.g. _8.2.11_.
See xref:maintenance/package_upgrade.adoc#upgrading-across-skipped-releases[Upgrading Across Skipped Releases] for more information.
