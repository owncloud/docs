== Introduction

If you want to add users and groups to your ownCloud installation via
the UCS (Univention Corporate Server) UI, here’s a concise guide showing
how.

== Login to the Univention Management Console

After logging in to the Univention server, under "**Administration**",
click the first option, labeled btn:[System and domain settings].

This takes you to the Univention Management Console.

== Create the User

Once there, click btn:[Users].

In the screen that appears, add a new user by clicking btn:[ADD] in
the top left-hand corner of the users table.

This opens up a new user dialog, where you can supply the relevant
details for the new user. Enter a username and optionally a first name,
last name, and a title. Then click btn:[NEXT].

In the next dialog that appears, enter and confirm the password. You
can, optionally, choose some further options, if desired. Then click
btn:[CREATE USER].

The new user will have been created, so click the btn:[CLOSE] button,
in the top right-hand corner, to go back to "**Favorites**".

== Create the Group

Now it’s time to create a new group. Click btn:[Groups], which is
located between "**Computers**" and "**Software Update**".

From there, click btn:[ADD], located on the left-hand side of the groups table.

In the next dialog that appears, first enter the name of the group and optionally a
description. Then, under "**Members of this group**", click btn:[ADD].

This opens up an "**Add objects**" (or "**Add new group**" ) dialog. Find
the user, in the list at the bottom, that you want to add to the group,
check the checkbox next to their name, and click btn:[ADD].

After that, click on btn:[ownCloud] in the left-hand side navigation, and check
the option btn:[ownCloud enabled]. And lastly, click btn:[CREATE GROUP].

With that done, the new user and group are now available in your
ownCloud installation.

Depending on your installation, you will either see these changes
immediately or you will have to wait for the user sync to be done. This
happens ever 10 minutes by default.
