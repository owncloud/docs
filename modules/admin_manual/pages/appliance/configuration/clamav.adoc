== Introduction

This guide details how to enable a virus scanner in the ownCloud
Appliance.

== Install ClamAV and Related Components

First, start the appliance and go to "**System and domain settings**".

When there, log in with the administrator account. After you have done
that, click btn:[Software] and open "**Package Management**", as in the screenshot below.

From there, you first need to install ClamAV. To do this, in the third
field, next to the one containing the text "**Package name**", type in
the phrase: "**clamav**" (1). Doing so filters the list of packages to
only those matching that phrase. In the filtered list of packages, check
the checkboxes next to "**clamav**" (2), "**clamav-freshclam**", and
"**clamav-daemon**".

After doing that, click btn:[INSTALL] (3) above the listed packages,
next to "**SHOW DETAILS**'".

After you do so, a confirmation dialog appears, as in the screenshot
below, asking for confirmation to install the packages. Confirm the
choice by again clicking btn:[INSTALL].

The installation should only take a few minutes.

== Configure ownCloud to Use ClamAV

Start the ClamAV service:

----
systemctl enable clamav-daemon.service
systemctl start clamav-daemon.service
----

Next you need to configure ClamAV in your ownCloud instance. Please refer to
xref:configuration/server/virus-scanner-support.adoc#configuring-the-clamav-antivirus-scanner[the ClamAV documentation]
for instructions on how to do that.

== Troubleshooting

""
If you try to update the ClamAV virus database manually, by entering
`freshclam`, and see the error below, it means that
https://linux.die.net/man/1/freshclam[freshclam] is already updating the database.
""

----
ERROR: /var/log/clamav/freshclam.log is locked by another process
ERROR: Problem with internal logger (UpdateLogFile = /var/log/clamav/freshclam.log).
----


Updates are run based on the configured time interval in the applicable
Cron job. In the example below, the update would run every 47 minutes:

----
# m   h  dom mon dow  command
47  *  *   *    *  /usr/bin/freshclam --quiet
----

If there are errors running the freshclam process, check if a process is
blocking the log file, by running the following command:

[source,console]
----
lsof /var/log/clamav/freshclam.log
----

If you want to refresh the ClamAV database manually, follow these steps:

[source,console]
----
# Gently end the freshclam process with this command:
sudo pkill -15 -x freshclam

# Start the refresh process again with this command:
sudo freshclam
----

[WARNING]
====
When the app is enabled — but is not configured or has an incorrect configuration — it will reject **all** uploads for the entire instance. To avoid this situation, make sure the ClamAV service is running and you have the execution mode correctly configured in ownCloud.
