= Working on Documents in the ownCloud Appliance
:toc: right
:page-aliases: appliance/office.adoc

== Introduction

Creating and editing documents in ownCloud can be achieved with either
Collabora or OnlyOffice. It’s your choice which one you prefer to use.

This guide covers the setup and update of the two office apps.

NOTE: Access with *HTTPS* using a *domain name* is required. Add the IP address and the domain name of your 
appliance to your `/etc/hosts` file, or have it added to your existing DNS server, if you don't want to 
use the Appliance as your DNS server.

== Appcenter

First you have to get to the Appcenter. Here are the steps to do that:

. Connect to your appliance using IP address or domain name.

[source,console]
----
https://172.16.40.100
# or
https://ucs-2341.CompanyName.com
----

* Login into the management console

** Click on the btn:[Domain and System] settings

** Type in the Administrator as username and the password you set.

* Now you can access the *Appcenter*".

xref:how-to-install-onlyoffice[OnlyOffice].
