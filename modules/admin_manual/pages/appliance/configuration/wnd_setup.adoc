= Windows Network Drive Configuration (WND)
:toc: right
:page-aliases: appliance/wnd_setup.adoc

== Introduction

Here are the steps to configure WND in the Appliance.

IMPORTANT: Windows Network Drive is avaialbe only in the Enterprise Editon of ownCloud.

NOTE: You will need both of the following described steps for each share.

NOTE: The steps need to be done in / on the docker host
(appliance virtual machine) and not inside the docker container

== WND Listener

Create a service following the instructions below that checks the share for changes:

* For each WND mount point distinguished by a SERVER - SHARE pair, 
** place one copy of a file
with following content under +
`/etc/systemd/system/owncloud-wnd-listen-SERVER-SHARE.service`
** replacing the all upper case words `SERVER`, `SHARE`, `USER` and `PASSWORD`
** in both, the **filename** and in the **contents** below with their respective values. +
Take care to also adjust the paths in `WorkingDirectory` and `ExecStart`
according to your installation.

* Run once for each created file the following commands:
+
[source,console]
----
sudo systemctl enable owncloud-wnd-listen-SERVER-SHARE.service
sudo systemctl start  owncloud-wnd-listen-SERVER-SHARE.service
----

== WND Process Queue

Create or add a `crontab` file in `/etc/cron.d/oc-wnd-process-queue`.

* Make a `crontab` entry to run a script iterating over all `SERVER SHARE` pairs with
an appropriate `occ wnd:process-queue` command. The commands must be **strictly sequential**.
This can be done by using `flock -n` and tuning the `-c` parameter of `occ wnd:process-queue`
