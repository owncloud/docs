= How to Install the Appliance
:toc: right
:page-aliases: appliance/installation.adoc

== Introduction

The installation process is a little involved, but not too much. 
To keep it succinct, you need to:

* xref:download-the-appliance[Download] and xref:launch-the-appliance[Launch] the appliance
* Step through xref:the-configuration-wizard[the configuration wizard]
* xref:activate-the-appliance[Activate] the configured appliance
* After that, you can access the running instance of ownCloud and further 
xref:administer-the-appliance[configure it] to suit your needs.

TIP: It's recommended to setup the appliance with a working DHCP Server and access to the internet.

The appliance has to be activated with a license that you will receive from Univention via email. 
This license has to be imported into the appliance via the *web interface*.

== Download the Appliance

First off, you need to download the ownCloud X Appliance from
https://owncloud.com/download[the ownCloud download page] and click btn:[DOWNLOAD NOW].
This will display a form, which you can see a sample of below, which you’ll need to fill out.
It will ask you for the following details:

* Email address
* Download version (_ESXi_, _VirtualBox_, _VMware_, _KVM_)
* Your first, last, and company names, and your country of origin

After you’ve filled out the form, click btn:[DOWNLOAD OWNCLOUD] to
begin the download of the virtual appliance.

The virtual appliance files are around 1.4GB in size, so may take some
time, depending on your network bandwidth.

You can also download it from
https://owncloud.org/download/#owncloud-server-appliance[the owncloud.org page].

== Launch the Appliance

Once you’ve downloaded the virtual appliance file, import it into your
virtualization software, accept the T’s & C’s of the license agreement,
and launch it. The example below shows this being done using VirtualBox.

If you try to install an ownCloud appliance in your domain after
removing an existing one, please remember to remove the original one
from you DNS configuration.

Don’t Forget the *IP Address* and the *Administrator Password*. You will need them to use the Appliance.

== Configuration wizard

Once imported, start the appliance. Doing so launches the installer wizard which helps you specify the core configuration. 

Follow this screenshot guide to securely and easily configure your appliance.

image:appliance/setup/1.png[Choose your Language and City]

Here, you can choose your **language**. 
Currently there are 2 options: English and German.
You can set your city, which will then automatically set the localization settings in the next screen.

image:appliance/setup/2.png[Localization Settings]

Here, you can set your default **language**, **time zone** and **keyboard layout**. 
This will be set automatically if you enter your City in the previous screen.

image:appliance/setup/3.png[Network Setup]

Here, you will see the automatically obtained **network configuration** if you have a DHCP server in your network. 
If not - you will have to set this yourself. 
You can also enter a alternate DNS server if you need one.

image:appliance/setup/4.png[Domain Options]

This is an important setting. 
**Choose the default option** if you don't have deep knowledge about Microsoft Active directory and the univention system.

image:appliance/setup/5.png[Administrator Account]

The second important setting during this setup: the **Administrator password**. 
You will need this to log in to your appliance and administer it. 
Please **write this password down**. 
Setting your email address here is optional, since you can set it later on.

image:appliance/setup/6.png[Host Settings]

Here, you can set or change the **FQDN** to your custom address.

image:appliance/setup/7.png[Confirmation]

Here, you get a finalized confirmation screen of what you have entered / set and you can finish the process. 
Note that if you let the check box to update your system in - the installation will take **considerably longer**. 
Keep his in mind. 
You can apply the updates later on if you choose to skip it during the installation.

image:appliance/setup/9.png[Installation]

Wait until the setup is finished.

image:appliance/setup/10.png[Success]

When the installation is complete, you will see this screen informing you that the installation was successful.

image:appliance/setup/11.png[Navigate to Address]

The VM will show you this screen, showing the ip **address** you have to navigate to in order to **activate** your appliance

image:appliance/setup/12.png[Request License]

Enter your email-address to receive a **license** to activate your Appliance. 
Without activation you **can not login** in to the appliance.

image:appliance/setup/13.png[Receive Email]

You will receive the email shortly. **Download** the license and **import** it in to the appliance.

image:appliance/setup/15.png[Activate Appliance]

Once activated, you will see this screen, informing you that the appliance was successfully activated.

== Administer the Appliance

Once activated, you should be redirected to the portal, which you can see below.

image:appliance/portal.png[Portal page.]

If you want to create new users and groups, or download apps from the
Univention appcenter click on the btn:[System and domain settings].
Login as the "**Administrator**" using the password that you supplied
during the configuration wizard earlier.

image:appliance/login-to-the-virtual-appliance.png[Administer the ownCloud X Trial Appliance.]

If you are not redirected to the appliance login page, you can open it
using the following url:
`\https://<ip address of the virtual machine>/univention-management-console`.

After you’ve done so, you will now be at the Univention management
console, which you can see below.

image:appliance/univention-management-console.png[The Univention Management Console.]

The management console allows you to manage the virtual appliance (1),
covering such areas as: _users_, _devices_, _domains_, and _software_.
You will also be able to access the ownCloud web interface (2).

The default username for the ownCloud is: `owncloud` and so is the
password. The password is *not* the password you supplied during the
configuration wizard.

For security reasons `rpcbind` should be disabled in the appliance. An
open, from the internet accessable portmapper service like `rpcbind` can
be used by an attacker to perform DDoS-Reflection-Attacks. Furthermore,
the attacker can obtain information about your system, for example
running rpc-services, or existing network shares. The German IT security
agency "BSI" reported, that systems with an open `rpcbind` service were
used to perform DDoS-Reflection-Attacks against other systems.

NOTE: If you want to create NFS shares on the appliance and give someone
permission to access them, then you can enable `rpcbind` again.
