= Firewall Protected Environment

If you are considering setting up the appliance in an environment with a firewall, please create rules that permit access to the following hosts. 
If your DNS is not working, you can use the IP addresses instead.
If you are using Google as your DNS server (IP=8.8.8.8), you have to permit access to it too.

Firewall Rules:
