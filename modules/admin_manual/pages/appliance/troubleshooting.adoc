= Troubleshooting

If you have encountered an issue, here is what support needs in order to get a quick resolution of your issue:

1.  Log file located at `/var/lib/univention-appcenter/apps/owncloud/data/files/owncloud.log`
2.  Config Report generated with `occ configreport:generate > config_report.json` (you have to login to the container with `univention-app shell owncloud`)
3.  The status of your docker containers `docker ps > docker.txt` 
4.  The status of your appliance `univention-app info > univention.txt`
5.  Docker Logs: find out your docker ID of the ownCloud container and then execute `docker logs <containerID or container name>`. Here is an example: `docker logs owncloud_owncloud_1`

**Restore a snapshot to get your appliance to a functional state again.**
