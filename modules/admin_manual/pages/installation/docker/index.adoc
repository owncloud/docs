= Installing with Docker
:toc: right

ownCloud can be installed using Docker, using
https://hub.docker.com/r/owncloud/server/tags[the official ownCloud Docker image].
This official image works standalone for a quick evaluation, but is designed to be used in a docker-compose setup.

== Quick Evaluation

`docker run -e OWNCLOUD_DOMAIN=localhost:{std-port-http} -p{std-port-http}:{std-port-http} owncloud/server`

== Docker Compose

The configuration:

* exposes ports {std-port-http}, allowing for HTTP connections.
* uses separate _MariaDB_ and _Redis_ containers.
* mounts the data and MySQL data directories on the host for persistent storage.

The following instructions assume you install locally. For remote access, the value of OWNCLOUD_DOMAIN must be adapted.

First, create a new project directory. Then copy and paste the sample
`docker-compose.yml` from this page
into that new directory. Next, create a .env configuration file, which contains the required
configuration settings. Only a few settings are required, these are:

[cols=3,options=header]
|===
| Setting Name
| Description
| Example

| `OWNCLOUD_VERSION`
| The ownCloud version
| `latest`

| `OWNCLOUD_DOMAIN`
| The ownCloud domain
| `localhost:{std-port-http}`

| `ADMIN_USERNAME`
| The admin username
| `admin`

| `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
| The admin user’s password
| `admin`

| `HTTP_PORT`
| The HTTP port to bind to
| `{std-port-http}`
|===

NOTE: `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` will not change between deploys even if you change the 
values in the .env file. To change them, you'll need to do `docker volume prune`, which 
*will delete all your data*.

Then, you can start the container, using your preferred Docker
command-line tool. The example below shows how to use
https://docs.docker.com/compose/[Docker Compose].

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
# Create a new project directory
mkdir owncloud-docker-server

cd owncloud-docker-server

# Copy docker-compose.yml from the GitHub repository
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owncloud/docs/master/modules/admin_manual/examples/installation/docker/docker-compose.yml

# Create the environment configuration file
cat << EOF > .env
OWNCLOUD_VERSION={latest-version}
OWNCLOUD_DOMAIN=localhost:{std-port-http}
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin
HTTP_PORT={std-port-http}
EOF

# Build and start the container
docker-compose up -d
----

When the process completes, then check that all the containers have
successfully started, by running `docker-compose ps`. If they are all
working correctly, you should expect to see output similar to that
below:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
Name                              Command                     State   Ports
__________________________________________________________________________________________
ownclouddockerserver_db_1         … /bin/s6-svscan /etc/s6    Up      {std-port-mysql}/tcp
ownclouddockerserver_owncloud_1   … /usr/bin/owncloud server  Up      0.0.0.0:{std-port-http}->{std-port-http}/tcp
ownclouddockerserver_redis_1      … /bin/s6-svscan /etc/s6    Up      {std-port-redis}/tcp
----

In it, you can see that the database, ownCloud, and Redis containers are running, and that only ownCloud is accessible via port {std-port-http} on the host machine.

[IMPORTANT]
====
All files stored in this setup are contained in Docker volumes, rather than a physical filesystem tree.
It is the admin's responsibility to persist the files.
Use, e.g., `docker volume ls | grep ownclouddockerserver` to inspect the volumes.
Use e.g., `docker run -v ownclouddockerserver_files:/mnt ubuntu tar cf - -C /mnt . > files.tar` to export the files as a tar archive.
====

[TIP]
====
Although the containers are up and running, it may still take a few minutes until ownCloud is fully functional.
Run, e.g., `docker-compose logs --follow owncloud` and inspect the log output.
Wait until the output shows "Starting apache daemon..." before you access the web UI.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Although all important data persists after `docker-compose down; docker-compose up -d`, there are certain details that get lost, e.g., default apps may re-appear after they were uninstalled.
====

=== Logging In

To log in to the ownCloud UI, open `http://localhost:{std-port-http}` in your browser
of choice, where you see the standard ownCloud login screen, as in the
image below.

image:docker/owncloud-ui-login.png[The ownCloud UI via Docker]

The username and password are the admin username and password which you
stored in `.env` earlier. Note that these will not change between deploys
even if you change the values in .env. 

=== Stopping the Containers

Assuming you used docker-compose, as in the previous example, to stop the containers use `docker-compose stop`.
Alternatively, use `docker-compose down --rmi all --volumes` to stop and remove containers, along with the related networks, images, and volumes.

=== Running occ command

If you want to run an occ command, first go to the directory where your `.yaml` or `.env` file is located.
Next, you are able to run any command referring to xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc[Using the occ Command], by entering: 

[source,console]
----
docker-compose exec owncloud occ <command>
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Don't use the `php` command prefix, this leads to several errors and is not intended to run in docker environments.
====

=== Upgrading ownCloud on Docker

When a new version of ownCloud gets released, you should update your
instance. To do so, follow these simple steps.

First, go to your docker directory where your `.yaml` or `.env` file
exists. Second, put ownCloud into maintenance mode; you can do so using
the following command:

[source,console]
----
docker-compose exec owncloud occ maintenance:mode --on
----

Third, create a backup in case something goes wrong during the upgrade
process, using the following command:

[source,console]
----
docker-compose exec db backup
----

NOTE: This assumes that you are using
https://hub.docker.com/r/webhippie/mariadb/[the default database container from Webhippie].

Fifth, shutdown the containers.

[source,console]
----
docker-compose down
----

Sixth, update the version number of ownCloud in your `.env` file or the
YAML file. You can use sed for it, as in the following example.

[source,console]
----
# Make sure that you adjust the example to match your installation.
sed -i 's/^OWNCLOUD_VERSION=.*$/OWNCLOUD_VERSION=<newVersion>/' /compose/*/.env
----

Seventh, view the file to ensure the changes has been implemented.

[source,console]
----
cat .env
----

Eighth, start your docker instance again.

[source,console]
----
docker-compose up -d
----

Now you should have the current ownCloud running with docker-compose.
Please note that the container will automatically run `occ upgrade` when starting up.
If you notice the container starting over and over again, you can check the update log with the following command:

[source,console]
----
docker-compose logs --timestamp owncloud
----

=== Docker Compose YAML File

NOTE: If you are an enterprise customer and are already registered on portal.owncloud.com, replace `image: owncloud/server` with `image: registry.owncloud.com/owncloud/enterprise` to be able to download our enterprise docker image.
Then, login to our registry by running `docker login registry.owncloud.com`, along with your portal credentials.

[source,yaml]
----
include::{examplesdir}installation/docker/docker-compose.yml[Example Docker Compose YAML configuration file for ownCloud Server.]
----

=== Troubleshooting

If you have issues logging in to the registry, make sure the `.docker` file is in your home directory.
If you installed Docker via `snap`, create a symbolic link to your home directory with the following command:

[source,console]
----
ln -sf snap/docker/384/.docker
----

The version `384` might differ from yours.
Please adjust it accordingly.
