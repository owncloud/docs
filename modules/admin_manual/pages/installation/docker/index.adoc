= Installing with Docker
:toc: right

ownCloud can be installed using Docker, using
https://hub.docker.com/r/owncloud/server/tags[the official ownCloud Docker image].
This official image works standalone (e.g. for a quick evaluation with `docker run -p{std-port-http}:{std-port-http} owncloud/server`) 
but it is designed to work with a data volume in
the host filesystem and with separate _MariaDB_ and _Redis_ containers.


The configuration:

* exposes ports {std-port-http}, allowing for HTTP connections.
* mounts the data and MySQL data directories on the host for persistent storage.

== Installation on a Local Machine

To use it, first create a new project directory and download `docker-compose.yml` from
https://github.com/owncloud-docker/server.git[the ownCloud Docker GitHub repository]
into that new directory. Next, create a .env configuration file, which contains the required 
configuration settings. Only a few settings are required, these are:

[cols=3,options=header]
|===
| Setting Name
| Description
| Example

| `OWNCLOUD_VERSION`
| The ownCloud version
| `latest`

| `OWNCLOUD_DOMAIN`
| The ownCloud domain
| `localhost`

| `ADMIN_USERNAME`
| The admin username
| `admin`

| `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
| The admin user’s password
| `admin`

| `HTTP_PORT`
| The HTTP port to bind to
| `{std-port-http}`
|===

Then, you can start the container, using your preferred Docker
command-line tool. The example below shows how to use
https://docs.docker.com/compose/[Docker Compose].

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
# Create a new project directory
mkdir owncloud-docker-server

cd owncloud-docker-server

# Copy docker-compose.yml from the GitHub repository
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owncloud/docs/master/modules/admin_manual/examples/installation/docker/docker-compose.yml

# Create the environment configuration file
cat << EOF > .env
OWNCLOUD_VERSION={latest-version}
OWNCLOUD_DOMAIN=localhost
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin
HTTP_PORT={std-port-http}
EOF

# Build and start the container
docker-compose up -d
----

When the process completes, then check that all the containers have
successfully started, by running `docker-compose ps`. If they are all
working correctly, you should expect to see output similar to that
below:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
Name                              Command                     State   Ports
__________________________________________________________________________________________
ownclouddockerserver_db_1         … /bin/s6-svscan /etc/s6    Up      {std-port-mysql}/tcp
ownclouddockerserver_owncloud_1   … /usr/bin/owncloud server  Up      0.0.0.0:{std-port-http}->{std-port-http}/tcp
ownclouddockerserver_redis_1      … /bin/s6-svscan /etc/s6    Up      {std-port-redis}/tcp
----

In it, you can see that the database, ownCloud, and Redis containers are running, and that only ownCloud is accessible via port {std-port-http} on the host machine.

[IMPORTANT]
====
All files stored in this setup are contained in Docker volumes, rather than a physical filesystem tree. 
It is the admin's responsibility to persist the files.
Use, e.g., `docker volume ls | grep ownclouddockerserver` to inspect the volumes.
Use e.g., `docker run -v ownclouddockerserver_files:/mnt ubuntu tar cf - -C /mnt . > files.tar` to export the files as a tar archive.
====

[TIP]
====
Although the containers are up and running, it may still take a few minutes until ownCloud is fully functional.
Run, e.g., `docker-compose logs --follow owncloud` and inspect the log output. 
Wait until the output shows "Starting apache daemon..." before you access the web UI.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Although all important data persists after `docker-compose down; docker-compose up -d`, there are certain details that get lost, e.g., default apps may re-appear after they were uninstalled.

=== Logging In

To log in to the ownCloud UI, open `http://localhost:{std-port-http}` in your browser
of choice, where you see the standard ownCloud login screen, as in the
image below.

The username and password are the admin username and password which you
stored in `.env` earlier.

=== Stopping the Containers

Assuming you used docker-compose, as in the previous example, to stop the containers use `docker-compose stop`. 
Alternatively, use `docker-compose down --rmi all --volumes` to stop and remove containers, along with the related networks, images, and volumes.

=== Upgrading ownCloud on Docker

When a new version of ownCloud gets released, you should update your
instance. To do so, follow these simple steps.

First, go to your docker directory where your `.yaml` or `.env` file
exists. Second, put ownCloud into maintenance mode; you can do so using
the following command:

[source,console]
----
docker-compose exec owncloud occ maintenance:mode --on
----

Third, create a backup in case something goes wrong during the upgrade
process, using the following command:

[source,console]
----
docker-compose exec db backup
----

NOTE: This assumes that you are using 
https://hub.docker.com/r/webhippie/mariadb/[the default database container from Webhippie].

Fifth, shutdown the containers.

[source,console]
----
docker-compose down
----

Sixth, update the version number of ownCloud in your `.env` file or the
YAML file. You can use sed for it, as in the following example.

[source,console]
----
# Make sure that you adjust the example to match your installation.
sed -i 's/^OWNCLOUD_VERSION=.*$/OWNCLOUD_VERSION=<newVersion>/' /compose/*/.env
----

Seventh, view the file to ensure the changes has been implemented.

[source,console]
----
cat .env
----

Eighth, start your docker instance again.

[source,console]
----
docker-compose up -d
----

Now you should have the current ownCloud running with docker-compose.
Please note that the container will automatically run `occ upgrade` when starting up.
If you notice the container starting over and over again, you can check the update log with the following command:

[source,console]
----
docker-compose logs --timestamp owncloud
----

=== Docker Compose YAML File

NOTE: If you are an enterprise customer and are already registered on portal.owncloud.com, replace `image: owncloud/server` with `image: registry.owncloud.com/owncloud/enterprise` to be able to download our enterprise docker image. 
Then, login to our registry by running `docker login registry.owncloud.com`, along with your portal credentials. 

[source,yaml]
----
include::{examplesdir}installation/docker/docker-compose.yml[Example Docker Compose YAML configuration file for ownCloud Server.]
----

=== Troubleshooting

If you have issues logging in to the registry, make sure the `.docker` file is in your home directory.
If you installed Docker via `snap`, create a symbolic link to your home directory with the following command:

[source,console]
----
ln -sf snap/docker/384/.docker
----

The version `384` might differ from yours. 
Please adjust it accordingly.
