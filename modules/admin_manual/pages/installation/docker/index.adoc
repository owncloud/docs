== Introduction

ownCloud can be installed using Docker, using the {docker-tags-url}[official ownCloud Docker image].
This official image works standalone for a quick evaluation, but is designed to be used in a
docker-compose setup.

[NOTE]
====
Preceding `sudo` in the docker commands is not necessary, if you add your user to the `docker` group
by invoking

[source,console]
----
sudo usermod -aG docker <your-user>
----
====

== Quick Evaluation

`sudo docker run -e OWNCLOUD_DOMAIN=localhost:{std-port-http} -p{std-port-http}:{std-port-http} owncloud/server`

== Docker Compose

The configuration:

* Exposes ports {std-port-http}, allowing for HTTP connections.
* Uses separate _MariaDB_ and _Redis_ containers.
* Mounts the data and MySQL data directories on the host for persistent storage.

The following instructions assume you install locally. For remote access, the value of OWNCLOUD_DOMAIN must be adapted.

. Create a new project directory. Then copy and paste the sample `docker-compose.yml` from this page
into that new directory.
. Create a `.env` configuration file, which contains the required configuration settings.

Only a few settings are required, these are:

[width="100%",cols="45%,50%,80%",options="header"]
|===
| Setting Name
| Description
| Example

| `OWNCLOUD_VERSION`
| The ownCloud version
| `latest`

| `OWNCLOUD_DOMAIN`
| The ownCloud domain
| `localhost:{std-port-http}`

| `ADMIN_USERNAME`
| The admin username
| `admin`

| `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
| The admin user’s password
| `admin`

| `HTTP_PORT`
| The HTTP port to bind to
| `{std-port-http}`
|===

NOTE: `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` will not change between deploys even if you change the 
values in the .env file. To change them, you'll need to do `docker volume prune`, which 
*will delete all your data*.

Then, you can start the container, using your preferred Docker _command-line tool_.
The example below shows how to use {docker-compose-url}[Docker Compose].

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
# Create a new project directory
sudo mkdir owncloud-docker-server

cd owncloud-docker-server

# Copy docker-compose.yml from the GitHub repository
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owncloud/docs/master/modules/admin_manual/examples/installation/docker/docker-compose.yml

# Create the environment configuration file
cat << EOF > .env
OWNCLOUD_VERSION={latest-version}
OWNCLOUD_DOMAIN=localhost:{std-port-http}
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin
HTTP_PORT={std-port-http}
EOF

# Build and start the container
sudo docker-compose up -d
----

When the process completes, check that all the containers have successfully started, by running
`sudo docker-compose ps`. If they are all working correctly, you should expect to see output
similar to that below:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
Name                              Command                     State   Ports
__________________________________________________________________________________________
ownclouddockerserver_db_1         … /bin/s6-svscan /etc/s6    Up      {std-port-mysql}/tcp
ownclouddockerserver_owncloud_1   … /usr/bin/owncloud server  Up      0.0.0.0:{std-port-http}->{std-port-http}/tcp
ownclouddockerserver_redis_1      … /bin/s6-svscan /etc/s6    Up      {std-port-redis}/tcp
----

In it, you can see that the database, ownCloud, and Redis containers are running, and that ownCloud
is accessible via port {std-port-http} on the host machine.

[IMPORTANT]
====
All files stored in this setup are contained in Docker volumes, rather than a physical filesystem tree.
It is the admin's responsibility to persist the files. +
To inspect the volumes run:
[source,console]
----
sudo docker volume ls | grep ownclouddockerserver`
----
To export the files as a tar archive run:
[source,console]
----
sudo docker run -v ownclouddockerserver_files:/mnt \
            ubuntu tar cf - -C /mnt . > files.tar
----
====

[TIP]
====
Although the containers are up and running, it may still take a few minutes until ownCloud is fully
functional. +
To inspect the log output:
[source,console]
----
sudo docker-compose logs --follow owncloud
----
Wait until the output shows **Starting apache daemon...** before you access the web UI.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Although all important data persists after:
[source,console]
----
sudo docker-compose down; docker-compose up -d
----
there are certain details that get lost, e.g., default apps may re-appear after they were uninstalled.
====

=== Logging In

To log in to the ownCloud UI, open `pass:a[http://localhost:{std-port-http}]` in your browser
of choice, where you see the standard ownCloud login screen, as in the
image below.

image:docker/owncloud-ui-login.png[The ownCloud UI via Docker]

The username and password are the credentials which you stored in `.env` earlier.
Note that these will not change between deploys even if you change the values in .env. 

=== Stopping the Containers

Assuming you used `docker-compose`, as in the previous example. +
To stop the containers use:
[source,console]
----
sudo docker-compose stop
----

To stop and remove containers, along with the related networks, images, and volumes:
[source,console]
----
sudo docker-compose down --rmi all --volumes
----

=== Running occ command

If you want to run an occ command, first go to the directory where your `.yaml` or `.env` file is located.
Next, you are able to run any command referring to
xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc[Using the occ Command], by entering: 

[source,console]
----
sudo docker-compose exec owncloud occ <command>
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Don't use the `php` command prefix, this leads to several errors and is not intended to run in
docker environments.
====

=== Upgrading ownCloud on Docker

When a new version of ownCloud gets released, you should update your instance. To do so, follow
these simple steps.

. Go to your docker directory where your `.yaml` or `.env` file exists.
. Put ownCloud into maintenance mode. You can do so using the following command:
+
[source,console]
----
sudo docker-compose exec owncloud occ maintenance:mode --on
----

. Create a backup in case something goes wrong during the upgrade process, using the following command:
+
[source,console]
----
sudo docker-compose exec db backup
----
+
NOTE: This assumes that you are using the {webhippie-mariadb-url}[default database container from Webhippie].

. Shutdown the containers.
+
[source,console]
----
sudo docker-compose down
----

. Update the version number of ownCloud in your `.env` file or the YAML file. You can use sed
for it, as in the following example.
+
[source,console]
----
# Make sure that you adjust the example to match your installation.
sed -i 's/^OWNCLOUD_VERSION=.*$/OWNCLOUD_VERSION=<newVersion>/' /compose/*/.env
----

. View the file to ensure the changes has been implemented.
+
[source,console]
----
cat .env
----

. Start your docker instance again.
+
[source,console]
----
sudo docker-compose up -d
----

Now you should have the current ownCloud running with `docker-compose`. Please note that the container will
automatically run `occ upgrade` when starting up. If you notice the container starting over and over again,
you can check the update log with the following command:

[source,console]
----
sudo docker-compose logs --timestamp owncloud
----

=== Docker Compose YAML File

[NOTE]
====
If you are an enterprise customer and are already registered on portal.owncloud.com, replace +
`image: owncloud/server` +
with +
`image: registry.owncloud.com/owncloud/enterprise` +
to be able to download our enterprise docker image. Then, login to our registry by running +
`sudo docker login registry.owncloud.com` +
along with your portal credentials.
====

[source,yaml]
----
include::{examplesdir}installation/docker/docker-compose.yml[Example Docker Compose YAML configuration file for ownCloud Server.]
----

== Troubleshooting

If you have issues logging in to the registry, make sure the `.docker` file is in your home directory.
If you installed Docker via `snap`, create a symbolic link to your home directory with the following command:

[source,console]
----
sudo ln -sf snap/docker/384/.docker
----

The version `384` might differ from yours. Please adjust it accordingly.
