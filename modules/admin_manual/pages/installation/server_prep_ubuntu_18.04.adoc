== Webserver and php

You only need to install one of the following webservers.
 
=== apache webserver + php

The following command installs Apache webserver and php.

[source,console]
----
sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php apache2
----

=== nginx webserver + php

The following command installs nginx webserver and php-fpm.

[source,console]

----

== Common Prerequisites

[source,console]
----
sudo apt install smbclient
sudo apt install redis-server
sudo apt install unzip
sudo apt install php-mysql php-mbstring php-gettext php-intl php-redis \
     php-imagick php-igbinary php-gmp php-curl php-gd php-zip php-imap \
     php-ldap php-bz2 php-phpseclib

== HASH Message Digest Framework

This framework does not need any manual interverntion anymore. +

- As of PHP 5.1.2, the Hash extension is bundled and compiled into PHP by default.
- As of PHP 7.4.0, the Hash extension is a core PHP extension, so it is always enabled.

For more information see following {hash-installation}[link]

== Exif Library

This library should be already part of php 7.2. +
Please check you `mods_available` directory and/or if the exif extension exists at all.

The following command lists all enabled php extensions:
[source,console]
----
ls `php -i | grep "^extension_dir" | sed -e 's/.*=> //'`
----

== PHP 7.2 Cryptography Library

Sodium and openssl are cryptographic libraries and already part of the php 7.2 core.
There is no need to install an aditional cryptographic library like `php-libsodium` or `mcrypt`.
The mcrypt library is depreciated and removed from the php 7.2 core and moved to PECL.

=== php-libsodium

If you get an error messages when invoking the command `php -v`
or on every PHP program: +
`PHP Fatal error: sodium_init() in Unknown on line 0` +
You might have installed `php-libsodium` additionally. +
This error does not have any harm but can be annoying. +
You have to uninstall `php-libsodium` as `sodium` is already part of the php 7.2 core: +
`sudo apt remove php-libsodium` +
You can check success by invoking the command `php -v` which should not return this error message anymore. +
You can also check the existance of `sodium` with following command:

[source,console]
----
php -i | grep "sodium"
sodium
sodium support => enabled
libsodium headers version => 1.0.16
libsodium library version => 1.0.16
----

=== mcrypt php library

Here are the steps for installing the mcrypt library in case you have
the desperate need for. +

Referencing the following {mcrypt-link-url}[link], some steps are adopted. +
Check the `mcrypt` version you want to use at following {mcrypt-pecl-url}[link].

[source,console]
----
sudo apt install php-dev libmcrypt-dev php-pear
sudo pecl channel-update pecl.php.net
sudo pecl install mcrypt-1.0.2
----

- Create a new file `mcrypt.ini` in `/etc/php/7.2/mods-available` with following content: +
`extension=mcrypt.so`
- Create in any subdirectory of `7.2` containing a `conf.d` directory a symbolic link: +
`sudo ln -s /etc/php/7.2/mods-available/mcrypt.ini 20-mcrypt.ini`
- You need to restart php and your webserver, example based on nginx: +
`sudo service php7.2-fpm restart` +
`sudo service nginx restart`

== libsmbclient-php library

[source,console]
----
sudo apt install php-dev libsmbclient-dev php-pear
sudo pecl channel-update pecl.php.net
sudo pecl install smbclient
----

- Create a new file `smbclient.ini` in `/etc/php/7.2/mods-available` with following content:
`extension=smbclient.so`
- Create in any subdirectory of `7.2` containing a `conf.d` directory a symbolic link: +
`sudo ln -s /etc/php/7.2/mods-available/smbclient.ini 20-smbclient.ini` +
- You need to restart php and your webserver, example based on nginx: +
`sudo service php7.2-fpm restart` +
`sudo service nginx restart`

NOTE: Due to a change in the minimum protocol version used in the samba client in
Ubuntu 18.04, you may not get a valid connection (red box at the mount definition
and/or cannot list directory content). +
In this case you have to add the following to +
`/etc/samba/smb.cnf` +
below the `workgroup =` statement: +
`client max protocol = NT1`. +
For more information see: {discover-samba-hosts}[Bionic Beaver can not discover samba hosts ]

== Database mariadb

For how to install the latest stable release see following {install-mariadb-latest}[link] +

In case you want to install phpmyadmin:

[source,console]
----
sudo apt install phpmyadmin
----

== Useful Tips

=== Tip1

If you have network resources eg NFS based mounts and you want to make sure that the database server or the web server only starts after the ressource has been mounted, look for following example.

Example based on an NFS mount you want to be available before the service starts.

- Add `_netdev` to the list of options of the NFS mountpoint in your fstab. +
This option makes sure that the mount will happen __after__ the network is up. +
`resource:path on local_path type nfs (<your options>,_netdev)`
- Make sure that all mounts in fstab are mounted by running `sudo mount -a`.
- Run `systemctl list-units` and look for the mount you want to be up. +
`folder.mount loaded active mounted local_path` +
Where `folder.mount` and `local_path` are examples. 
- Add `folder.mount` after `After=network.target` in your `/etc/systemd/system/<name.service>` +
Example: `After=network.target folder.mount`
- Run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`
- Restart your service by invoking +
`sudo system <your service> restart`.
