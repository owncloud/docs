== Web Server and PHP

Only *one* of the following web servers is required:

* xref:apache-web-server-and-php-supported[Apache Web Server and PHP (Supported)]
* xref:apache-web-server-and-php-fpm-unsupported[Apache Web Server and PHP-FPM (Unsupported)]
* xref:nginx-web-server-and-php-fpm-unsupported[Nginx Web Server and PHP-FPM (Unsupported)]

=== Apache Web Server and PHP (Supported)

The following command installs the Apache web server and PHP.

[source,console]
----
sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php apache2
----

=== Apache Web Server and PHP-FPM (Unsupported)

The following command installs and enables the Apache web server with php-fpm.
This setup can be used in high throughput environments. 

[source,console]
----
# Install PHP-FPM and Apache2 
sudo apt install php-fpm apache2

# Disable relevant modules
sudo a2dismod php7.2
sudo a2dismod mpm_prefork
sudo a2enmod proxy_fcgi

# Enable the php7.2-fpm configuration
sudo a2enconf php7.2-fpm

# Enable relevant modules
sudo a2enmod mpm_event
sudo a2enmod http2

# Start Apache2
sudo service apache2 restart
----

TIP: For performance comparison details, please refer to https://www.cloudways.com/blog/php-fpm-on-cloud/[this guide from Cloudways].

For examples of how to configure this setup, please refer to:

* http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_proxy.html#handler[The mod_proxy Access via Handler documentation] 
* https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_proxy_fcgi.html[The mod_proxy_fcgi documentation] 
* https://wiki.apache.org/httpd/PHP-FPM[High-performance PHP on apache httpd 2.4.x using mod_proxy_fcgi and php-fpm]

=== Nginx Web Server and PHP-FPM (Unsupported)

To install the Nginx web server and PHP-FPM, run the following command.

[source,console]
----
sudo apt install php-fpm nginx
----

For details of how to configure Nginx, please refer to xref:installation/nginx_configuration.adoc[the NGINX Configuration].

== Common Prerequisites

[source,console]
----
# Applications suggested for the use with ownCloud
sudo apt install smbclient
sudo apt install redis-server

# Applications needed for the use with ownCloud
sudo apt install unzip
sudo apt install openssl

# PHP extensions needed to use ownCloud
sudo apt install php-mysql php-mbstring php-gettext php-intl php-redis \
     php-imagick php-igbinary php-gmp php-curl php-gd php-zip php-imap \
     php-ldap php-bz2 php-phpseclib
----

If you want to retrieve a list of enabled PHP extensions run following command:

[source,console]
----
ls `php -i | grep "^extension_dir" | sed -e 's/.*=> //'`
----

== HASH Message Digest Framework

This framework does not need manual intervention anymore, because

* as of PHP 5.1.2, the Hash extension is bundled and compiled into PHP by default.
* as of PHP 7.4.0, the Hash extension is a core PHP extension, so it is always enabled.

For more information refer to {hash-installation}[PHP's Hash Installation documentation].

== Exif Library

This library _should_ be already as part of PHP 7.2. +
However, you can check if it is by running the following command.

[source,console]
----
grep -q -P 'EXIF Support => enabled' <(php -i) && echo "Exif is installed and enabled"
----

== PHP 7.2 Cryptography Library

The sodium and OpenSSL PHP libraries are cryptographic libraries which are part of the PHP 7.2 core.
Consequently, there is no need to install additional cryptographic libraries, such as `php-libsodium` or `mcrypt`.

NOTE: The `mcrypt` library is deprecated and removed from the PHP 7.2 core. However, it is available via PECL.

=== php-libsodium

If you see the message `PHP Fatal error: sodium_init() in Unknown on line 0` when invoking the command `php -v` or when running PHP programs, `php-libsodium` might be installed.
This error does not do any harm, but it can be annoying and will fill up your logs.

To prevent it, you have to uninstall `php-libsodium`.
You can do this by running the following command.

[source,console]
----
sudo apt remove php-libsodium
----

You can check success by invoking the command `php -v` which should not return this error message anymore.
You can also check the existence of `sodium` with following command:

[source,console]
----
grep -P "sodium support => enabled" <( php -i )
----

=== Mcrypt PHP Library

Here are the steps for installing Mcrypt — when it is explicitly necessary.

NOTE: Some of the steps were borrowed from the Website for Student’s {mcrypt-link-url}[guide to installing the PHP 7.2-Mcrypt module].

First, determine the Mcrypt version you want to use in {mcrypt-pecl-url}[PECL's Mcrypt documentation].
Then, run the following commands to install it.

[source,console]
----
sudo apt install php-dev libmcrypt-dev php-pear
sudo pecl channel-update pecl.php.net
sudo pecl install mcrypt-<desired mcrypt version>
----

When the commands complete, you then have to:

* Create `/etc/php/7.2/mods-available/mcrypt.ini` with the following content: `extension=mcrypt.so`.
* Enable the module by running `phpenmod mcrypt`.
* Restart php-fpm and your web server, by running the following commands:
+
  sudo service php7.2-fpm restart
  sudo service nginx restart

== libsmbclient-php Library

`libsmbclient-php` is a PHP extension that uses Samba's libsmbclient library to provide
Samba-related functions to PHP programs. You only need to install it, if you have
installed `smbclient` as described above. To install it, run the following commands.

[source,console]
----
sudo apt install php-dev libsmbclient-dev php-pear
sudo pecl channel-update pecl.php.net
sudo pecl install smbclient
----

When the commands complete, you then have to:

- Create `/etc/php/7.2/mods-available/smbclient.ini` with following content `extension=smbclient.so`.
- Enable the module by running `phpenmod smbclient`.
- Restart PHP and your web server by running the following command:
+
  sudo service php7.2-fpm restart
  sudo service apache2 restart

[NOTE]
====
Due to a change in the minimum protocol version used in the samba client in Ubuntu 18.04, you may not get a valid connection in ownCloud
This error is identified by a red box at the mount definition or being unable to list directory content.
In this case, you have to add the following to `/etc/samba/smb.cnf`, below the `workgroup =` statement:

`client max protocol = NT1`

For more information see: {discover-samba-hosts}[Bionic Beaver can not discover Samba hosts]
====

== MariaDB Database

For how to install the latest stable release of MariaDB, please refer to {install-mariadb-latest}[the MariaDB installation documentation].

NOTE: During the installation of the MariaDB server, you will be prompted to create a root
password. Be sure to remember your password as you will need it during ownCloud database setup.

If you want to install phpMyAdmin as a graphical interface for administrating the database, run the following command:

[source,console]
----
sudo apt install phpmyadmin
----

== Useful Tips

=== Start a Service after a Resource is Mounted

If you have network resources, such as NFS based mounts, and you want to make sure that the database or web server only starts _after_ the resource is mounted, consider the following example to help configure your system correctly.

The example is based on an NFS mount which you want to be available before the service with <name.service> starts.

- Using the example below, add `_netdev` to the list of NFS mountpoint options in `/etc/fstab`.
This option ensures that the mount will happen __after__ the network is up.
`resource:path on local_path type nfs (<your options>,_netdev)`
- Make sure that all mounts in `/etc/fstab` are mounted by running `sudo mount -a`.
- Run `systemctl list-units | grep -nP "\.mount"` and look for the mount you want to be up.
You should see the following printed to the console: `<folder.mount> loaded active mounted <local_path>`, where `folder.mount` and `local_path` are examples. 
- In `/etc/systemd/system/<name.service>` add `folder.mount` after the directive `After=network.target`
For example: `After=network.target folder.mount`.
- Run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`
- Restart your service by invoking `sudo system <your service> restart`.
