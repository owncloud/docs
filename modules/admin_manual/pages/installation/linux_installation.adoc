== Add the ownCloud Repository

Before you can install `owncloud-files`, you need to add ownCloud's repository to your distribution's package manager.
The instructions for doing so, are available https://download.owncloud.org/download/repositories/stable/owncloud/index.html[here].

NOTE: Package managers should only be used for single-server setups. For production environments, we recommend installing from
https://owncloud.org/download/#owncloud-server-tar-ball[the tar archive].

== Available Packages

The recommended package to use is `owncloud-files`. 
It only installs ownCloud, and does not install Apache, a database, or any of the required PHP dependencies.

== Avoid Automatic Upgrades

If you are installing ownCloud using one of the various Linux package managers, we *strongly* recommend that you avoid automatically updating the `owncloud-files` package, when running a system update or upgrade and when upgrading other packages.
That way, there are no surprise changes (whether positive or negative) to your ownCloud installation.

Here are the ways to do so for xref:apt[APT], xref:yum[Yum], and xref:zypper[Zypper].

=== APT

If you are using APT, use {apt-mark-hold-url}[apt-mark hold] to  mark the `owncloud-files` package as held.
Here’s an example of how to do so:

[source,console]
----
apt-mark hold owncloud-files
----

To see if owncloud-files has already been held, use the `showhold` command, as in the following example.
If it’s printed out to the console, then it’s being held.

[source,console]
----
apt-mark showhold owncloud-files
----

To unset `owncloud-files` as held back, use the `unhold` command, as in the example below.

[source,console]
----
apt-mark unhold owncloud-files
----

=== Yum

If you are using Yum, there are two options that you can take to lock packages from being upgraded.
You can:

. Add `exclude=owncloud-files` to `/etc/yum.conf`
. Use {yum-versionlock-plugin-url}[the versionlock plugin] for Yum.

==== The VersionLock Plugin

If the `versionlock` plugin is not installed, install it by running:

----
yum install yum-plugin-versionlock
----

When it is installed, you can lock `owncloud-files` run:

----
yum versionlock add owncloud-files
----

To confirm that it is locked, run: 

----
yum versionlock list
----

To unlock `owncloud-files`, run: 

----
yum versionlock delete owncloud-files
----

=== Zypper

If you are using Zypper, use the `addlock` or `al` commands.
Similar to `apt-mark hold` these add a package lock that prevents the package from being modified.
The example below shows how to use the command to lock `owncloud-files`.

[source,console]
----
zypper addlock owncloud-files
----

To see if the package has already been locked, use the `locks` command. 
If `owncloud-files` is already locked, then you will see output similar to the below example.

[source,console]
----
# | Name           | Type    | Repository
--+----------------+---------+-----------
1 | owncloud-files | package | (any)
----

To unlock `owncloud-files`, if it is already locked, use the `removelocks` or `rl` commands, as in the example below.

[source,console]
----
zypper removelock owncloud-files
----

== Installing ownCloud Community Edition

First, install your own LAMP stack, as doing so allows you to create
your own custom LAMP stack without dependency conflicts with the
ownCloud package. Then,
http://download.owncloud.org/download/repositories/production/owncloud/[update package manager’s configuration].

Configurations are available for the following Linux distributions:

* Ubuntu 14.04 & 16.04
* Debian 7 & 8
* RHEL 6 & 7
* CentOS 7.2 & 7.3
* SLES 11SP4 & 12SP2
* openSUSE Leap 42.2 & 42.3

NOTE: Repositories for Fedora, openSUSE Tumbleweed, and Ubuntu 15.04 have been dropped. 
If you use Fedora, use https://owncloud.org/download/#owncloud-server-tar-ball[the tar archive] with your own LAMP stack. openSUSE users can rely on LEAP packages for Tumbleweed.

Once your package manager has been updated, follow the rest of the
instructions on the download page to install ownCloud. Once ownCloud’s
installed, run xref:installation/installation_wizard.adoc[the Installation Wizard] to complete
your installation.

NOTE: See the system_requirements for the recommended ownCloud setup and supported platforms.

IMPORTANT: Do not move the folders provided by these packages after the installation, as this will break updates.

=== What is the Correct Version?

Package versions are composed of a major, a minor, and a patch number,
such as 9.0, 9.1, 10.0, 10.0.1, and 10.0.2. The second number represents
a major release, and the third number represents a minor release.

==== Major Releases

If you want to follow either of the most recent major releases, then
substitute `version` with either 9.0 or 10.0.

==== Minor Releases

If you want to follow any of the four most recent patch releases, then
substitute `version` with one of 10.0.1, 10.0.2, 10.0.3, or 10.0.4.
Following a minor release avoids you accidentally upgrading to the next
major release before you’re ready.

==== The Latest Stable Version

Alternatively you can use `stable` for the latest stable version. If you
do, you never have to change it as it always tracks the current stable
ownCloud version through all major releases.

== Installing ownCloud Enterprise Edition

See xref:enterprise/installation/install.adoc[the enterprise installation guide]
for instructions on installing ownCloud Enterprise edition.

== Downgrading

Downgrading is not supported and risks corrupting your data! If you want
to revert to an older ownCloud version, install it from scratch and then
restore your data from backup. Before doing this, file a support ticket
(https://owncloud.com/pricing/[if you have paid support]) or ask for
help in the ownCloud forums to see if your issue can be resolved without
downgrading.

== Additional Guides and Notes

See installation_wizard for important steps, such as choosing the best
database and setting correct directory permissions. See
xref:installation/configuration_notes_and_tips.adoc#config-notes-and-tips-selinux[the SELinux guide]
for a suggested configuration for SELinux-enabled distributions such as _Fedora_ and _CentOS_.

If your distribution is not listed, your Linux distribution may maintain
its own ownCloud packages or you may prefer to xref:installation/manual_installation.adoc[install from source].

=== Archlinux

The current 
https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/owncloud-client/[client stable version] is in the official community repository,
more packages are in the https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?O=0&K=owncloud[Arch User Repository].

=== Mageia

The https://wiki.mageia.org/en/OwnCloud[Mageia Wiki] has a good page on
installing ownCloud from the Mageia software repository.

=== Note for MySQL/MariaDB environments

Please refer to 
xref:configuration/database/linux_database_configuration.adoc#mysql-mariadb-with-binary-logging-enabled[MySQL / MariaDB with Binary Logging Enabled]
on how to correctly configure your environment if you have binary logging enabled.

=== Running ownCloud in a sub-directory

If you’re running ownCloud in a sub-directory and want to use CalDAV or CardDAV clients, make sure you have configured the correct xref:configuration/general_topics/general_troubleshooting.adoc#service-discovery[service discovery URLs].
