= Using Let’s Encrypt SSL Certificates
:toc: right
:toclevels: 1

== Introduction

This page covers how to configure your web server to use
https://letsencrypt.org[Let’s Encrypt] as the certificate authority for
your ownCloud server. Note that Let’s Encrypt is _not officially
supported_, and this page is _community-maintained_.
Thank you, contributors!

* For ease of handling, SSL-specific directives have been moved into a
separately included file. This can help for first-time certificate
issuance as well as for reusing configurations.
* The examples shown are based on Ubuntu 18.04.
* Read the https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html[Certbot user guide]
for details of the commands.
* Let’s Encrypt CA issues short-lived certificates valid for 90 days.
Make sure you renew the certificates at least once in this period,
because expired certificates need reissuing. A certificate is due for
renewal earliest 30 days before expiring. Certbot can be forced to renew
via options at any time as long the certificate is valid.

TIP: Raymii.org provides https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Strong_SSL_Security_On_Apache2.html[an excellent introduction to strong SSL security measures with Apache], if you would like to know more.

== Requirements & Dependencies

You require a domain name with a valid
https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/a-record/[A-Record] pointing back
to your servers IP address. In case your server is behind a firewall, take
the necessary measures to ensure that your server is accessible, worldwide,
from the internet, by adding the required firewall and port forward rules.

== Install Let’s Encrypt’s Certbot Client

The https://certbot.eff.org[Certbot] client can be installed in following ways:

1. Installation via xref:via-apt[APT install]
2. With the Ubuntu xref:via-ppa[PPA repository].

=== Via APT

To install Certbot via APT, run the following commands.

[source,console]
----
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install certbot
----

=== Via PPA

To install Certbot via the PPA repository, run the following commands. +
These will add the repository, update APT’s cache, and install Certbot.

NOTE: This method is preferred when you’re using a version of Ubuntu prior to 18.04.

[source,console]
----
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
sudo apt-get install certbot
----

=== Run Certbot

To run Certbot use the following command:

[source,console]
----
sudo certbot
----

[NOTE]
====
Depending on how you installed Let’s Encrypt, certbot may also be named `letsencrypt` or
`certbot-auto`. However, this guide will refer to it as `certbot`. Please bear that in
mind, and update the examples and scripts used in this guide to reflect your Certbot
installation.
====

== Updating Certbot

If you need to update Certbot at a later date, run:

[source,console]
----
sudo apt-get install --only-upgrade certbot
----

== Register Your Email Address

=== First Time Registration

Now that Certbot is installed, register your email address for urgent renewal
and security notifications. This command also prepares Certbot’s environment
if it’s not already installed. To do this, run the following command:

[source,console]
----
sudo certbot register --agree-tos --email <your-email-address>
----

When it executes, you’ll see a question similar to the following, which you can answer "Yes" or "No":

----
Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Would you be willing to share your email address with the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, a founding partner of the Let's Encrypt project and the non-profit
organization that develops Certbot? We'd like to send you email about EFF and
our work to encrypt the web, protect its users and defend digital rights.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Y)es/(N)o:
----

When that completes, you’ll see a message similar to the following:

----
IMPORTANT NOTES:
 1. Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
    configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
    secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
    also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
    making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
----

Please, *strongly*, consider following its recommendation.

=== Update Your Registration

In case you want to update your registered email address use following command:

NOTE: This will affect all the certificates issued using this account.

[source,console]
----
sudo certbot register --update-registration --email <your-email-address>
----

When that completes, you’ll see a message similar to the following:

----
Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Create Let’s Encrypt’s Config Files

* Create following files in the Let’s Encrypt directory. They will help
to maintain your certificates.
* Replace the path to Certbot and the Certbot script name based on your
installation. +
You can find it by running `which certbot`.
* Rename <your-domain-name>.sh with the name of the domain(s) you want
to issue a certificate for. +
As an example, the script could be renamed to `your-domain-name.com.sh`.
* Make all files executable except `cli.ini` by running
`sudo chmod +x <script-name>`.

NOTE: All scripts have to be executed with `sudo`.

[source,console]
----
cd /etc/letsencrypt
touch cli.ini list.sh renew.sh renew-cron.sh delete.sh <your-domain-name>.sh
----

=== cli.ini

This file defines some default settings used by Certbot. Use the email address
you registered with. Comment / un-comment the post-hook parameter
according which web server you use.

[source,console]
----
include::{examplesdir}installation/lets_encrypt/cli.ini[]
----

=== list.sh

This script lists all your issued certificates.

[source,console]
----
include::{examplesdir}installation/lets_encrypt/list.sh[]
----

=== renew.sh

This script:

* Renews all your issued certificates.
* In case you have enabled the post hook for your webserver in `cli.ini`, it will reload
the web server configuration automatically if a certificate has been renewed.

[source,console]
----
include::{examplesdir}installation/lets_encrypt/renew.sh[]
----

=== renew-cron.sh

This script:

* Renews all your issued certificates but does not upgrade Certbot.
* In case you have enabled the post hook for your webserver in `cli.ini`, it will reload
the web server configuration automatically if a certificate has been renewed.

NOTE: This script is intended for use via Cron.

[source,console]
----
include::{examplesdir}installation/lets_encrypt/renew-cron.sh[]
----

=== delete.sh

This script deletes an issued certificate. +
Use the `list.sh` script to list issued certificates.

[source,console]
----
include::{examplesdir}installation/lets_encrypt/delete.sh[]
----

=== <your-domain-name>.sh

As an example, this script creates a certificate for following domain /
sub-domains. You can add or remove sub-domains as necessary. Use your
domain / sub-domain names. The first (sub)domain name used in the script
is taken for naming the directories created by Certbot.

[NOTE]
====
You can create different certificates for different sub-domains, such as
`example.com`, `www.example.com`, and `subdomain.example.com`, by creating different scripts.
====

[source,console]
----
include::{examplesdir}installation/lets_encrypt/your-domain-name.sh[]
----

NOTE: You can enable the `--dry-run` option which does a test run of the client only.

== Create an SSL Certificate

With all the scripts created, to create an SSL certificate, run the
following command:

[source,console]
----
sudo /etc/letsencrypt/<your-domain-name>.sh
----

After you run the script, you will see output similar to the following:

----
Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
Obtaining a new certificate
Performing the following challenges:
http-01 challenge for your-domain-name.com
Using the webroot path /var/www/html for all unmatched domains.
Waiting for verification...
Cleaning up challenges
Running post-hook command: service apache2 reload

IMPORTANT NOTES:
 1. Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
    /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain-name.com/fullchain.pem
    Your key file has been saved at:
    /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain-name.com/privkey.pem
    Your cert will expire on 2018-06-18. To obtain a new or tweaked
    version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot
    again. To non-interactively renew *all* of your certificates, run
    "certbot renew"
 2. If you like Certbot, please consider supporting our work by:

    Donating to ISRG / Let's Encrypt:   https://letsencrypt.org/donate
    Donating to EFF:                    https://eff.org/donate-le
----

You can see that the SSL certificate’s been successfully created, and
that it will expire on 2018-06-18.

== Listing Existing Certificates

If you want to list (view) existing SSL certificates, use `list.sh`,
which can be run as follows:

[source,console]
----
sudo /etc/letsencrypt/list.sh
----

Depending on the number of certificates, you can expect to see output
similar to the following:

----
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Found the following certs:
  Certificate Name: your-domain-name.com
    Domains: your-domain-name.com
    Expiry Date: 2018-06-18 10:57:18+00:00 (VALID: 82 days)
    Certificate Path: /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain-name.com/fullchain.pem
    Private Key Path: /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain-name.com/privkey.pem
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

== Web Server Setup

Refer to xref:installation/letsencrypt/apache.adoc[the Apache setup guide], to set up your web server and issue a certificate.

== Test the Setup

After you have setup and configured the web server and installed the SSL
certificate using Certbot, you should now test the security of your new
configuration. To do so, you can use the free service of
https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/[SSL Labs]. See an example screenshot of
a test run below.

image:installation/ssllabs.png[ssllabs]

== Renewing SSL Certificates

As Let’s Encrypts certificates expire every 90 days, you should ensure
you renew them before that time. +
There are two ways to do so:
xref:manual-renewal[manually] and xref:automatic-renewal-via-crontab[automatically].

=== Manual Renewal

If you have provided your email address, you will receive reminder notifications.

[source,console]
----
sudo /etc/letsencrypt/renew.sh
----

If the certificate is not yet due for renewal, you can expect to see
output similar to that below:

----
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Processing /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/your-domain-name.com.conf
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cert not yet due for renewal

The following certs are not due for renewal yet:
  /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain-name.com/fullchain.pem (skipped)
No renewals were attempted.
No hooks were run.
----

=== Automatic Renewal via Crontab

Certificates are only renewed if they are due, so you can schedule Cron
jobs to renew your SSL certificates on a more frequent basis. However, a
weekly check is sufficient.

To add a new Cron job to auto-renew your certificates, firstly run the
following command to edit the job list.

[source,console]
----
sudo crontab -e
----

IMPORTANT: It is essential to use `sudo` to derive proper permissions.

Then, add the following at the end of the existing configuration:

----
30 03 * * 6 /etc/letsencrypt/renew-cron.sh
----

After you save and exit the file, the new job will have been added to
the Cron job scheduler.

NOTE: If you want to use own values, you can check them eg. at
https://crontab.guru[crontab.guru] or modify the script for other options.

== Add Extra Domains to the Certificate

If you want to add an extra domain, like `subdomain.example.com`, to your
certificate, add the domain in the domain shell script above, re-run it
and reload the web server config. This can be useful when migrating from
a sub-directory to sub-domain access.

NOTE: This also implies that you need to comment the `include` directive
(please refer to the relevant xref:web-server-setup[web server setup])
and follow the steps afterwards.

== Deleting SSL Certificates

If you want to delete an SSL certificate, use the delete.sh script, running it as follows:

[source,console]
----
sudo /etc/letsencrypt/delete.sh
----

It will start off, as below, by displaying a list of the currently
available SSL certificate domain names, and then prompt you to supply
the certificate that you want to delete.

----
Available Certificates:

1. your-domain-name.com

Which certificate do you want to delete:
----

Provide the SSL certificate name that you want to delete and click
btn:[enter], and the certificate and all of its related files will be deleted.
After that you should expect to see a confirmation, as in the example
output below.

----
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deleted all files relating to certificate your-domain-name.com.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----
