== Introduction

This guide helps you to compile a particular {samba_home_url}[Samba] version from source which
includes `smbclient`. This may be necessary if the provided version of your OS can not connect to
a file server, in particular to older non Microsoft file servers.

NOTE: The guide has been tested, is at it is and comes without any warranty.

== Prerequisites

WARNING: It is highly recommended to stop your Web Server and if configured `php-fpm` services.

=== Uninstalling `samba`

If you have already installed `smbclient` provided by your OS and you installed the `smbclient`
extension from PECL (to support smbclient in PHP) you need to uninstall them first. Follow the
steps described below to do so.

NOTE: Copy your smb.conf or other configurations files you may want to keep to reuse them later on.
Purging deletes the config files and helps to make a clean basis. 

[source,console]
----
sudo phpdismod smbclient
sudo pecl uninstall smbclient
sudo apt purge smbclient
sudo apt autoremove
----

=== Preparing the Installation Environment

To compile Samba, you need to install necessary packages. Copy the referenced content from
{samba_req_pack_url}[Bootstrap Dependencies Script] from Samba for Ubuntu 18.04 which can also
be used for Ubuntu 20.04. You will find it in section _Verified Package Dependencies_. Post
downloading, make the script executable and execute it (use the name how you called it). For your
convenience, you can download the file
link:{attachmentsdir}/installation/manual_installation/bootstrap.sh[bootstrap samba master] here.

[source,console]
----
sudo ./bootstrap.sh
----

== Prepare Compiling Samba

=== Download Your Copy of Samba

The latest version of Samba, which had support for protocol `NT1` as client was version 4.10.18. In all
versions above, the client support was dropped and is not available anymore. If you need `NT1` support
as client, download this version. You can chose any version that fits your needs. A search on
{bugzilla}[bugzilla] may help finding a particular version that fixes the issue you are facing, which is not
provided by the OS delivered version. Keep the downloaded (and later configured) version at a location for
later reuse. This will be necessary if you would like to uninstall it properly. The example uses `/opt`.

[source,console]
----
cd /opt
sudo wget https://download.samba.org/pub/samba/stable/samba-4.10.18.tar.gz
----

=== Extract Samba Sources

[source,console]
----
sudo tar -xvf samba-4.10.18.tar.gz
cd samba-4.10.18
----

== Compile Samba

To compile Samba, you need three steps which are described in detail at
{samba_fromsource_url}[Build Samba from Source]. The complete process may take some time.

. `sudo ./configure` <options>
. `sudo make` <options>
. `sudo make install`

=== Configuring the Installation

The settings for the configuration options are important, so that Samba will be located and setup
for Ubuntu properly. If you are planning to use Samba in your installation where your server
_will act_ as domain controller and not only as a client, you can safely remove `--without-ad-dc`
from the options below. Read more on details {samba_conf_options_url}[config options] for Ubuntu. 

[source,console]
----
sudo ./configure \
	--prefix=/usr \
	--enable-fhs \
	--sysconfdir=/etc \
	--localstatedir=/var \
	--with-privatedir=/var/lib/samba/private \
	--with-smbpasswd-file=/etc/samba/smbpasswd \
	--with-piddir=/var/run/samba \
	--with-pammodulesdir=/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/security \
	--libdir=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu \
	--with-modulesdir=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/samba \
	--datadir=/usr/share \
	--with-lockdir=/var/run/samba \
	--with-statedir=/var/lib/samba \
	--with-cachedir=/var/cache/samba \
	--with-socketpath=/var/run/ctdb/ctdbd.socket \
	--with-logdir=/var/log/ctdb \
	--systemd-install-services \
	--without-ad-dc
----

=== Start the Compilation

Start the compilation with following command. Even not mandatory, you can set options to run
multiple jobs in parallel by adding `-j <n>`. This optimizes the CPU utilisation and reduces
the time needed. In the example below, four jobs are enabled to utilisize the 4 available cores
of the CPU.

[source,console]
----
sudo make -j 4
----

=== Install the Compiled Software

To install the compiled software run following command:

[source,console]
----
sudo make install -j 4
----

=== Create a Default `smb.conf` File

If you do not have an existing or already configured `smb.conf` file, you can create a default one.
The following command creates a new `smb.conf` if it does not exist, but does not overwrite an existing one.

[source,console]
----
sudo cp -n examples/smb.conf.default /etc/samba/smb.conf
----

=== Uninstall the Compiled Software

Uninstalling can be necessary, if you want to have a clean base. This is useful if you want to compile a
different version or the version provided by the OS. To uninstall the compiled software run following command:

[source,console]
----
sudo make uninstall -j 4
----

== Testing

=== Connection Test to Foreign Host

When the installation has completed, test your result. If you have used a `smb.conf` file before,
copy it back to its original location (`/etc/samba/`).

[source,console]
----
sudo smbclient --version
Version 4.10.18
----

[source,console]
----
sudo smbclient -L <file_server_name> -U <full_domain_name>/<user_name>
----

You now should get a proper response with a directory listing.

=== Connection Test as Standalone Fileserver

If you want that this server acts as simple standalone smb fileserver, eg for testing, you need to
prepare and set some settings. Following tasks are necessary to start and stop smb as service via systemd.
The smbd service is necessary that your server can act as simple smb file server.

First create a link to the smb service.

[source,console]
----
sudo ln -s /lib/systemd/system/smb.service /etc/systemd/system/smbd.service
----

Then, change some startup parameters. These will not be overwritteon on the source file, but be added
via a separate non-destructive process.

[source,console]
----
sudo sudo systemctl edit smbd.service
----

Add following content and save the result. The location and naming will be done automatically.
Just say save.

----
[Unit]
After=
After=network.target remote-fs.target nss-lookup.target

[Service]
Type=
Type=forking
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/smbd --configfile=/etc/samba/smb.conf
----

When finished, reload the daemon to recognize the update:

[source,console]
----
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
----

Finally, you can start (stop, reload ect), the smbd service with:

[source,console]
----
sudo service smbd start
----

When this is done and the service has started successfully, adopt your smb.conf according your needs as
stand alone fileserver, test the content by invoking the command `testparm` on the command line and restart
the smbd service. You should then be able to connect to this stand alone samba server.

== Reinstalling Pecl smbclient

If you had removed `pecl smbcient` before, you can reinstall it now with:

[source,console]
----
sudo pecl channel-update pecl.php.net
sudo pecl install smbclient
sudo phpenmod smbclient
----

== Restart Services
 
Restart your Web Server and/or `php-fpm` when everything is finished.
