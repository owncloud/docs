= Manual Installation

In this section, you find *Installation Guides* for manually setting up ownCloud.

Consider the following before deciding on a path of installation:

The xref:installation/manual_installation/manual_installation.adoc[Detailed Installation Guide] gives more detailed information and describes individual setup
possibilities. It may not fit all audiences as it requires a deeper background knowledge. As a
bonus, it provides ready to use scripts which need some preconfiguration to run successfully.
The scripts are "as it is" and we cannot take any responsibility for them working properly.

The xref:installation/quick_guides/index.adoc[Quick Installation Guide] is useful for basic setups. All commands
necessary are provided for you to simply copy&paste, but little information is provided beyond bare instructions. If you use this guide, ownCloud will be up and running in very little time, but these basic setups are not recommended for production systems.
