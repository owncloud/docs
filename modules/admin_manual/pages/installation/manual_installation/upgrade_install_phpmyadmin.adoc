== Introduction

This guide helps you to upgrade an existing installation of {phpmyadmin_home_url}[phpmyadmin]
from source. This may be necessary if the provided version of your OS lacks behind the available
version and/or you see php errors when using it and you need an updated version.

NOTE: `phpmyadmin` gets rarely upgraded as Ubuntu installation. Usually only on Ubuntu LTS upgrades.
In case Ubuntu upgrades in between, just redo the procedure described below.

NOTE: The guide has been tested, is at it is and comes without any warranty.
 
== Prerequisites

Please note, you must already have an existig, configured and working `phpmyadmin` installation.
Check your existing version with following command:

[source,console]
----
sudo apt-cache policy phpmyadmin
----

When using `phpmyadmin`, post login, look at the bottom right side to see the actual version running.

You will find the existing installation in directory: `/usr/share/phpmyadmin`

== Upgrade `phpmyadmin`

To download `phpmyadmin`, see the {phpmyadmin_dl_url}[phpmyadmin download page] and select a
version that fits your needs. Then start downloading, extracting and putting the files to the
correct location. 

=== Download and Move

The following example uses `phpMyAdmin-5.0.4-all-languages` as basis for upgrading. It renames the
old installation because we need to keep some basic configuration settings. 

[source,console]
----
cd /tmp
sudo wget https://files.phpmyadmin.net/phpMyAdmin/5.0.4/phpMyAdmin-5.0.4-all-languages.tar.gz
sudo tar -xvf phpMyAdmin-5.0.4-all-languages.tar.gz
sudo mv /usr/share/phpmyadmin /usr/share/phpmyadmin.old
sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/phpmyadmin
sudo cp -r phpMyAdmin-5.0.4-all-languages/. /usr/share/phpmyadmin
sudo rm -r phpMyAdmin-5.0.4-all-languages*
----

=== Recreate Basic Configuration Settings

Because the upgrade has default basic configuration settings, it is necessary to recreate them
based on the former settings coming from the Ubuntu installation. The file to change can be found
in `/usr/share/phpmyadmin/libraries/vendor_config.php`. To keep a copy of the original file from
the update, create a backup with:

[source,console]
----
cd /usr/share/
sudo cp phpmyadmin/libraries/vendor_config.php phpmyadmin/libraries/vendor_config.php.orig
----

Then, open two editors of your choice in parallel with following files:

(1) - `phpmyadmin/libraries/vendor_config.php` +
(2) - `phpmyadmin.old/libraries/vendor_config.php`

**Step One**

Search in (1) for `define('TEMP_DIR', ROOT_PATH . 'tmp/');` +
Search in (2) for `define('TEMP_DIR',` +

Replace in (1) `ROOT_PATH . 'tmp/'` with the value of (2).
This can be eg: `'/var/lib/phpmyadmin/tmp/'` 

**Step Two**

Search in (1) for `define('CONFIG_DIR', ROOT_PATH);` +
Search in (2) for `define('CONFIG_DIR',` +

Replace in (1) `ROOT_PATH` with the value of (2).
This can be eg: `'/etc/phpmyadmin/'` 

== Testing

When the upgrade has finished, test it by logging in. When succeeded, check the actual version
running at the bottom right of the screen.

When you are fine with your upgrade, you can safely delete the old installation files.

[source,console]
----
cd /usr/share/
sudo rm -r /usr/share/phpmyadmin.old
----
