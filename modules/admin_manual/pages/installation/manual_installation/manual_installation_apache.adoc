== Introduction

This document describes the basic configuration of your Apache webserver for the use with
ownCloud. It assumes that you already have successfully installed the Apache Webserver.
Please read the {apache_doc_url}[Apache Documentation] for more or enhanced configuration options.

== Configure Apache

On Debian, Ubuntu, and their derivatives, Apache installs with a useful configuration.
All you have to do is create an `/etc/apache2/sites-available/owncloud.conf` file with these lines in it,
replacing the *Directory* and other file paths with your own file paths:

[source,apache]
----
Alias /owncloud "/var/www/owncloud/"

<Directory /var/www/owncloud/>
  Options +FollowSymlinks
  AllowOverride All

 <IfModule mod_dav.c>
  Dav off
 </IfModule>
</Directory>
----

Then create a symlink to /etc/apache2/sites-enabled:

----
sudo ln -s /etc/apache2/sites-available/owncloud.conf /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/owncloud.conf
----

== Additional Apache Configurations

* For ownCloud to work correctly, you need the module `mod_rewrite`. Enable it by running: `a2enmod rewrite`. Additionally recommended modules are `mod_headers`, `mod_env`, `mod_dir`, `mod_mime`, and `mod_unique_id`. To enable them, run the following commands:
+
[source,console]
----
sudo a2enmod headers
sudo a2enmod env
sudo a2enmod dir
sudo a2enmod mime
sudo a2enmod unique_id
----
+
NOTE: If you want to use the {oc-marketplace-url}/apps/oauth2[OAuth2 app], then {mod_headers_url}[mod_headers] must be installed and enabled.

* You must disable any server-configured authentication for ownCloud since it uses basic authentication internally for DAV services. If you have turned on authentication on a parent folder (e.g. via an `AuthType Basic` directive), you can disable the authentication specifically for the ownCloud entry. As in the above example configuration file, add the following line in the `Directory` section:
+
----
Satisfy Any
----

* When using SSL, take special note of the `ServerName`. You should specify one in the server configuration as well as in the `CommonName` field of the certificate. If you want your ownCloud to be reachable via the internet, set both of these to the domain for your ownCloud server. 

* Now restart Apache
+
----
sudo service apache2 restart
----

* If you’re running ownCloud in a sub-directory and want to use CalDAV or CardDAV clients, make sure you have configured the correct
xref:configuration/general_topics/general_troubleshooting.adoc#service-discovery[Service Discovery] URLs.

=== Apache Mod_Unique_Id Configuration

The use of `mod_unique_id` enables an administrator to trace requests via logfiles.

NOTE: {mod_unique_id_url}[mod_unique_id] provides a magic token for each request which is guaranteed to be unique across "all" requests under very specific conditions.

If you enable the module, there is nothing else you have to do as ownCloud automatically includes the `UNIQUE_ID` environment variable, provided by the module, in ownCloud's log file.

To confirm that it's working, check that the `UNIQUE_ID` environment variable is being set by running `phpinfo()` (like in the screenshot below).

image:installation/webservers/apache/mod_unique_id/phpinfo.png[phpinfo() showing that Apache 
is sending the UNIQUE_ID value from mod_unique_id]

Next, compare the value set for `UNIQUE_ID` in the output of `phpinfo()` with the value in ownCloud's log file to ensure that they're the same. In the example below, you can see an example log entry, where ownCloud is logging the unique id provided by Apache as the value for the first key `reqId` in the record.

[source,json]
----
include::{examplesdir}installation/webservers/apache/log-entry.json[]

=== Using SSL

You can use ownCloud over plain HTTP, but we strongly encourage you to use SSL/TLS to encrypt all of your server traffic and to protect users’ logins and data in transit.

==== Use a Professional Certificate

You can install any purchased or free certificate like the ones via Let's Encrypt.

Read 
xref:installation/letsencrypt/index.adoc[Using Let's Encrypt SSL Certificates]
if you want to use free of charge certificates for Apache.

==== Use the Default Simple Self-Signed Certificate

Apache installed on an Ubuntu system comes already set up with a simple self-signed certificate.

NOTE: Self-signed certificates have their drawbacks - especially when you plan to make your ownCloud server publicly accessible. You may want to consider getting a certificate signed by a commercial signing authority or a free certificate like the ones from Let's Encrypt.

Using the simple self-signed certificate provided by the Apache installation, all you have to do is to enable the `ssl` module and the default site. Open a terminal and run:

[source,console]
----
sudo a2enmod ssl
sudo a2ensite default-ssl
sudo service apache2 reload
----

=== Multi-Processing Module (MPM)

{prefork_url}[Apache prefork] has to be used. Don’t use a threaded `MPM` like `event` or
`worker` with `mod_php`, because PHP is currently {php-net-url}/manual/en/install.unix.apache2.php[not thread safe].

If you want to use a threaded MPM, look at a FastCGI configuration where PHP is running
in its own memory space. ownCloud limit´s its support to Apache prefork only.
