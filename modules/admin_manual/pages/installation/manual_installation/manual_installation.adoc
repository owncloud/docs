== Introduction

This document describes:

* Prepare your server
* Prerequisites and how to download ownCloud
* Install ownCloud

The descriptions are focussing on the Ubuntu distribution. Even if we try to make these steps
as easy as possible by offering ready to use commands and scripts, you need to have sufficient
knownledge about administrating a server environment which provides webservices.
This document does not give any proposals securing your server.

== Prepare Your Server

For more information about the requirements of your server, read the 
xref:installation/manual_installation/manual_installation_prerequisites.adoc[general prerequisites guide].
The following sections takes care about the procedures in detail.

=== Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Server

To prepare your Ubuntu 18.04 server for the use with ownCloud, follow the
xref:installation/manual_installation/server_prep_ubuntu_18.04.adoc[Ubuntu 18.04 preparation guide].
This guide installs PHP up to version 7.3 only.

=== Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Server

To prepare your Ubuntu 20.04 server for the use with ownCloud, follow the
xref:installation/manual_installation/server_prep_ubuntu_20.04.adoc[Ubuntu 20.04 preparation guide].
This guide installs PHP 7.4

=== Install a Database

If you do not already have installed a supported database or using an existing one, follow the
xref:installation/manual_installation/manual_installation_db.adoc[Manual Installation Databases guide].

=== Configure the Web Server

To configure your Apache Web Server for the use with ownCloud, follow the
xref:installation/manual_installation/manual_installation_apache.adoc[Apache preparation guide].

== Installation of ownCloud Binaries

To install ownCloud binaries, you have to download the required package. After doing so,
you can do the following steps manually, or use provided scripts. These scripts are benificial,
because they also can be used for upgrading and ease the process a lot. 
 
=== Download ownCloud

Before downloading the ownCloud package, change to a directory where you will save
your file temporarily. This can be, for example `/tmp`. In further examples, we use tar archives and
the actual `ownCloud Complete Package`. The package name for the complete package is formed the following:
`owncloud-complete-yyyymmdd.archive_type`.
 
Download the archive of the latest ownCloud version:

. Go to the {download_oc_url}[ownCloud Download Page] and select the package that fits your needs.
  You can download either the `.tar.bz2` or `.zip` archive. Based on the example below, copy the
  link of the selected file and run following command to download it: +
+
[source,console]
----
wget https://download.owncloud.org/community/owncloud-complete-yyyymmdd.tar.bz2
----

. Download the corresponding checksum file like:
+
[source,console]
----
wget https://download.owncloud.org/community/owncloud-complete-yyyymmdd.tar.bz2.md5
  or
wget https://download.owncloud.org/community/owncloud-complete-yyyymmdd.tar.bz2.sha256
----

. Verify the MD5 or SHA256 sum:
+
[source,console]
----
sudo md5sum -c owncloud-complete-yyyymmdd.tar.bz2.md5 < owncloud-complete-yyyymmdd.tar.bz2
 or
sudo sha256sum -c owncloud-complete-yyyymmdd.tar.bz2.sha256 < owncloud-complete-yyyymmdd.tar.bz2
----

. You can also verify the PGP signature:
+
[source,console]
----
wget https://download.owncloud.org/community/owncloud-complete-yyyymmdd.tar.bz2.asc

gpg --verify owncloud-complete-yyyymmdd.tar.bz2.asc owncloud-complete-yyyymmdd.tar.bz2
----

=== Script Guided Installation

Use the xref:installation/manual_installation/script_guided_install.adoc[Script Guided Installation]
if you want to easily install or upgrade ownCloud or manage ownership and permissions. The page
contains detailed instructions about downloading and usage.

TIP: Using the _Script Guided Installation_, you can handle many useful installation and update
options automatically.

=== Command Line Guided Installation

Use these steps, if you want to do the basic setup without any changes or physical installation options.
Consider using the xref:installation/manual_installation/script_guided_install.adoc[Script Guided Installation]
if you plan improving your setup from step one.

* Extract the archive contents and run the unpacking command for your tar archive:
+
[source,console]
----
tar -xjf owncloud-complete-yyyymmdd.tar.bz2
----

* tar unpacks to a single `owncloud` directory. 
  Copy the ownCloud directory to its final destination. 
  When you are running the Apache HTTP server, you may safely install ownCloud in your Apache document root.
  Assuming you document root is in `/var/www`.
+
[source,console]
----
cp -r owncloud /var/www
----

Post physical installation, set the correct ownership and permissions upfront.
To do so, it is suggested use the scripts from the
xref:installation/manual_installation/script_guided_install.adoc[Script Guided Installation].

== Complete the Installation

After restarting Apache, you must complete your installation by running either the
Graphical Installation Wizard or on the command line with the `occ` command.

After finalizing the installation, re-run the script provided in
xref:installation/manual_installation/script_guided_install.adoc[Script Guided Installation]
to secure your `.htaccess` files. Your ownCloud instance is now ready to use.

=== Finalize Using the Graphical Installation Wizard

To finalize the installation using the the graphical installation wizard, refer to the
xref:installation/installation_wizard.adoc[Graphical Installation Wizard].

=== Finalize Using the Command Line

If you want to finalize the installation via the command line, use the following example
command. The command assumes, that you have unpacked the source to `/var/www/owncloud/`.
Replace all the parameters according your needs.

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
cd /var/www/owncloud/
{occ-command-example-prefix} maintenance:install \
   --database "mysql" \
   --database-name "owncloud" \
   --database-user "root"\
   --database-pass "password" \
   --admin-user "admin" \
   --admin-pass "password"
----

To use `occ` refer to the xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc[occ command reference]. +

NOTE: Admins of SELinux-enabled distributions may need to write new SELinux rules to complete
their ownCloud installation; see
xref:installation/configuration_notes_and_tips.adoc#config-notes-and-tips-selinux[the SELinux guide]
for a suggested configuration.

== Post Installation Configuration

After installing ownCloud successfully, ownCloud recommends that you perform some post
installation tasks. These tasks help to configure background jobs or improve performance
by caching.

=== Background Jobs

To read more about background jobs and how to configure them, read the
xref:configuration/server/background_jobs_configuration.adoc[Background Job Configuration] guide.

=== Configure Caching

It is recommended to install and enable caching (PHP opcode Cache and/or Data Cache), which
significantly improves performance. For more information read the
xref:configuration/server/caching_configuration.adoc[Caching Configuration] guide.

== Notes

=== Headers

NOTE: ownCloud has a mechanism to set headers programmatically. 
These headers are set with the `always` directive to avoid errors when there are additional
headers set in the web servers configuration file like `http.conf`. 
More information on headers can be found in the {mod_headers-url}[`mod_headers`] documentation.

=== Managing Trusted Domains

All URLs used to access your ownCloud server must be white-listed in your `config.php` file,
under the `trusted_domains` setting. Users are allowed to log into ownCloud only when they
point their browsers to a URL that is listed in the `trusted_domains` setting.

NOTE: This setting is important when changing or moving to a new domain name. 
You may use IP addresses and domain names.

A typical configuration may look like this:

[source,php]
----
'trusted_domains' => [
   0 => 'localhost',
   1 => 'server1.example.com',
   2 => '192.168.1.50',
],
----

The loopback address, `127.0.0.1`, is automatically white-listed, so as long as you have access to the physical server you can always log in. 
In the event that a load-balancer is in place, there will be no issues as long as it sends the correct `X-Forwarded-Host` header.

NOTE: For further information on improving the quality of your ownCloud installation, please see xref:installation/configuration_notes_and_tips.adoc[the configuration notes and tips guide].

NOTE: Admins of SELinux-enabled distributions such as _CentOS_, _Fedora_, and _Red Hat Enterprise Linux_ may need to set new rules to enable installing ownCloud. 
See xref:installation/configuration_notes_and_tips.adoc#config-notes-and-tips-selinux[SELinux] for a suggested configuration.
