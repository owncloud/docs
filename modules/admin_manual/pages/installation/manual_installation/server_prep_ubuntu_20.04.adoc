== Introduction

The target audience for this document are more sophisticated admins with additional needs and
setup scenarios. Ubuntu 20.04 default only provides PHP 7.4. In case you are running a PHP
version lower than 7.4, your PHP version is either already EOL or, for PHP 7.3, it will be EOL
in 2021. Consider upgrading to PHP 7.4. For more information see
{php-supported-versions-url}[Currently Supported PHP Versions]. This document considers two basic scenarios.
You have/plan to upgrade from 18.04 LTS to 20.04 LTS or you have a fresh Ubuntu 20.04 LTS installation.

IMPORTANT: PHP 8.0 is not currently supported by the ownCloud server.

NOTE: The commands and links provided in this description should give you proper hints but are
without any responsibility.

== Upgrading from Ubuntu 18.04 to 20.04

Without going into the upgrade details, you can now upgrade directly from to Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
to 20.04 LTS without using the _development_ (`-d`) option when using the `do-release-upgrade`
command. For more details see an example description at
{ubuntu_upgrade_url}[Upgrade Ubuntu 18.04 to 20.04 LTS using command line]

[source,console]
----
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt dist-upgrade
sudo apt autoremove
sudo apt install update-manager-core
sudo do-release-upgrade
----

In case you have upgraded successfully and you had previously installed any versions of PHP,
it is advised to uninstall all PHP versions and ALL extensions and focus on a fresh PHP 7.4 native
installation. This is especially true when using the `ondrej php` PPA as it installs all available
PHP versions, which are either no longer needed or supported or will run EOL in 2021. To do so,
stop any services which depend on or use PHP like your Web Server. Then get a list of all PHP
related programs and extensions by typing:

[source,console]
----
dpkg -l | grep php | awk '{print $2}' | tr "\n" " "
----

Disable all extensions listed (see the section
xref:useful-commands-for-managing-php-extensions[Useful Commands For Managing PHP Extensions])

Then purge them step by step

[source,console]
----
sudo apt purge <package name from the list above>
----

Alternatively, if you are fine removing all packages listed, you can run:

[source,console]
----
sudo apt purge `dpkg -l | grep php | awk '{print $2}' | tr "\n" " "`
----

NOTE: Keep a copy of your relevant `php.ini` and other configuration files as reference _before_
you start purging, to quickly reconfigure your PHP 7.4 installation afterwards.

If you had installed the `ondrej php` PPA, remove it, else it will reinstall PHP from this
source again. To do so run:

[source,console]
----
sudo apt install ppa-purge
sudo ppa-purge ppa:ondrej/php
sudo rm -i /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ondrej-ubuntu-php-*
sudo apt update
----

You can also follow this guide to remove PPAs: {remove_ppa_url}[How to Remove or Delete PPA in Ubuntu].

WARNING: If you have not cleanly removed that ppa you may get conflicts when installing php.

After deinstallation of all versions and extensions of PHP and cleaning up all remnants, you
should have an empty `/etc/php` directory. You can proceed like on a fresh installation
of Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

== Clean Ubuntu 20.04 Installation

After you have installed your Ubuntu 20.04 LTS server from scratch, use the following commands to
install PHP 7.4 and necessary extensions:

[source,console]
----
sudo apt install php-fpm php-cgi
sudo apt install php
sudo apt install php-mysql php-mbstring php-intl php-redis php-imagick \
         php-igbinary php-gmp php-bcmath php-curl php-gd php-zip php-imap \
         php-ldap php-bz2 php-ssh2 php-phpseclib php-common php-json php-xml
sudo apt install php-dev libsmbclient-dev php-pear
----

Use the following commands to install some common prerequisites:

[source,console]
----
sudo apt install smbclient
sudo apt install redis-server
sudo apt install unzip
sudo apt install openssl
sudo apt install rsync
sudo apt install imagemagick
----

The following step is necessary to upgrade PEAR because of a change in PHP 7.4.1+
Note that you should always use the {pear-package_url}[latest stable PEAR release].

[source,console]
----
pear version
sudo mkdir -p /tmp/pear/cache
sudo pear upgrade --force --alldeps http://pear.php.net/get/PEAR-1.10.13
sudo pear clear-cache
sudo pear update-channels
sudo pear upgrade --force
sudo pear upgrade-all
pear version
----

If you get any notices containing `You should add "extension=...`, check if the extension is
listed in `mods-available`. If it is not present, add the .ini file as required manually and
xref:useful-commands-for-managing-php-extensions[enable it].

Post upgrading pear, you can safely remove the directory `/tmp/pear/cache`.

Please see the xref:php-imagick-library[php-imagick Library] section for reason to install an updated version of ImageMagick.

== Important Note on `smbclient`

On Ubuntu 18.04, the default `smbclient` version was 4.7.6. With Ubuntu 20.04 the version provided
is 4.11.6, the actual compilable version is 4.13.x. If you have successfully configured and
connected `smbclient` under Ubuntu 18.04 to a Windows Server, you may now get issues
connecting to older NAS systems. Some requirements are now stricter than before or have changed.

If you needed to set `client max protocol = NT1` before in `smb.conf` to connect, you may get
with samba 4.11+ a response like `Max protocol NT1 is less than min protocol SMB2_02` which
highlights a disabled former connectivity. Starting with Samba version 4.11, the NT1 protocol has
been removed completely.

To check if you are affected connecting to a particular file server, do tests with the Ubuntu
provided version like:

[source,console]
----
host -t SRV _ldap._tcp.<full_domain_name>
----

If you do not get SRV records printed, your dns settings may need a change. The first DNS server
must be able to resolve your LDAP Active Directory request properly. If not, `smbclient` can not
find a KDC to check credentials.

[source,console]
----
sudo smbclient -L <file_server_name> -U <full_domain_name>/<user_name>
----

Any other output than a list of shares, like the error message +
`tree connect failed: NT_STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER` +
shows, that this target server is affected. This may impact your onwCloud installation when using
SMB shares with that file server.

The only solution that can be suggested is, to compile a working Samba version on your own.
This xref:installation/manual_installation/compile_samba.adoc[Compact Samba Compiling Guide]
helps how to do that.

== Apache Web Server

The following command installs the Apache Web Server.

[source,console]
----
sudo apt install libapache2-mod-php apache2
----

Even not supported by ownCloud, you can configure Apache to use `php-fpm`, the
FastCGI Process Manager, which is a non-standard setup and not covered by this document.

== Multiple Concurrent PHP Versions

If you have multiple concurrent PHP versions installed, which will happen when using the
{ondrej-php-url}[ondrej/php] PPA, you must tell your Web Server and your CLI environment which
one to use. Using the `ondrej/php` PPA may be needed if you want to test or prepare for the
latest PHP version like PHP 8. Please note that `ondrej/php` installs _ALL_ versions of PHP.
To list all available versions installed and choose one from them, use the following command:

[source,console]
----
sudo update-alternatives --config php
----
Here is an example output:

[source,console]
----
There are 2 choices for the alternative php (providing /usr/bin/php).

  Selection    Path             Priority   Status
------------------------------------------------------------
* 0            /usr/bin/php7.4   74        auto mode
  1            /usr/bin/php7.4   74        manual mode
  2            /usr/bin/php8.0   80        manual mode

Press <enter> to keep the current choice[*], or type selection number:
----

You can also directly set the required PHP version:

[source,console]
----
sudo update-alternatives --set php /usr/bin/php7.4
----

WARNING: After selecting your PHP version, it is **highly** recommended to switch to the correct
compiling environment which is essential e.g. when using PECL!

[source,console]
----
sudo update-alternatives --set phar /usr/bin/phar7.4
sudo update-alternatives --set phar.phar /usr/bin/phar.phar7.4
sudo update-alternatives --set phpize /usr/bin/phpize7.4
sudo update-alternatives --set php-config /usr/bin/php-config7.4
----

When using Apache PHP-FPM, you have to configure your PHP version in an Apache config
file manually. In any case, the PHP version used must always be the same.

You can read more about `update-alternatives` command on the {update-alternatives_url}[man page].

WARNING: Please be advised, when switching a php version, you **MUST** also configure the
corresponding php.ini files and extensions used accordingly! Extension binaries are **not** shared!

WARNING: You may get completely unexpected behaviour or a broken environment if the PHP version
for the Web Server and for CLI are different!

=== Avoiding a Nasty Pitfall

If you are using a PECL install later on, check the output of the installation command soon after
it has started. You will find a text like:

[source,console]
----
...
PHP Api Version:         20190902
Zend Module Api No:      20190902
...
----

Then do a test by just entering the following command:

[source,console]
----
php -i | grep extension_dir
----

If the output is different than the style below, there is a problem that needs fixing:

[source,console]
----
extension_dir => /usr/lib/php/20180731 => /usr/lib/php/20180731
----

This is the output that shows a fix is needed:

[source,console]
----
PHP Warning:  PHP Startup: smbclient: Unable to initialize module
Module compiled with module API=20190902
PHP    compiled with module API=20180731
These options need to match
----

As you see above, the API modules do not match and have been compiled with different versions
and therefore will not work. To fix this, uninstall the Pecl module with
`pecl uninstall <extension_name>`, set the correct `update-alternatives` as described above
and reinstall it.

== libsmbclient-php Library

`libsmbclient-php` is a PHP extension that uses Samba's libsmbclient library to provide
Samba-related functions to PHP programs. You need to install it, if you have installed
`smbclient` as described above. `smbclient` is e.g. necessary, if you are using the
xref:enterprise/external_storage/windows-network-drive_configuration.adoc[Windows Network Drives app]
from ownClouds Enterprise Edition. To install it, run the commands described below.
You can find more information about `smbclient` and the latest version on {pecl_url}[PECL].

[source,console]
----
sudo pecl channel-update pecl.php.net
sudo pecl install smbclient
----

When the commands complete, you then have to (assuming you use PHP 7.4):

- Create `/etc/php/7.4/mods-available/smbclient.ini` with following content `extension=smbclient.so`.
- Enable the module by running `phpenmod smbclient`.
- Restart PHP and your web server by running the following command:
+
[source,console]
----
sudo service apache2 restart
----

NOTE: Do not get confused by the name `smbclient`. It is on the one hand a
{smbclient_url}[command-line SMB/CIFS client for Unix], and on the other hand the package
name for the {pecl_url}[PECL smbclient] PHP extension

NOTE: Alternatively you can install `smbclient` from {libsmbclient-php_url}[source].

== php-imagick Library

When using new or extended formats for previews like HEIC or SVG, the standard installation of ImageMagick 6 and its php-imagick wrapper version 3.4 lacks this functionality. You have to manually install ImageMagick 7 and an updated php wrapper. To do so, follow the xref:installation/manual_installation/manual_imagick7.adoc[Install an Updated ImageMagick Version] guide. See the xref:configuration/files/previews_configuration.adoc[Previews Configuration] guide how to enable preview providers for various file types.

== Useful Commands For Managing PHP Extensions

=== List Enabled PHP Extensions

If you want to retrieve a list of enabled PHP extensions run following command:

[source,console]
----
ls `php -i | grep "^extension_dir" | sed -e 's/.*=> //'` | sort
----

=== Enabling and Disabling PHP Extensions

To enable or disable a PHP extension for CLI, FPM or Apache, use the commands
`phpenmod` or `phpdismod`.

Example:
[source,console]
----
sudo phpenmod php-ldap
# or
sudo phpdismod php-ldap
----

Type the command without parameters or see this {php-common}[guide] to read more about the commands
in the php-common package.

== Notes for PHP Library phpseclib

phpseclib's BigInteger uses the php-gmp (GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library), php-bcmath and OpenSSL extensions,
if they're available, for speed, but doesn't require them to maintain maximum compatibility.
The GMP library uses an internal resource type, while the BCMath library uses strings as datatype.
The most salient difference is, that GMP works on _arbitrary precision integer values_, whereas BCMath
allows _arbitrary precision] decimal / float-like values_.

== Database Installation

To install a database, see the
xref:installation/manual_installation/manual_installation_db.adoc[Manual Installation Databases guide].

NOTE: Follow the procedure described in xref:useful-tips[Useful Tips], if you want to
`Disable Transparent Huge Pages (THP),Transparent Huge Pages`

You may want to use the latest version of phpmyadmin as the OS default versions lags behind
the {phpmyadmin_latest_url}[latest available stable] version a lot and may report PHP errors with
PHP 7.3 onwards. Follow this
xref:installation/manual_installation/upgrade_install_phpmyadmin.adoc[quick upgrade guide]
to install it.
