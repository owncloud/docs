== Introduction

The target audience for this document are more sophisticated admins with additional needs and
setup scenarios. Ubuntu 18.04, by design, only provides PHP 7.2. Because PHP 7.2 security
support ends in November 2020, you may want to consider using PHP 7.3. If you want to install
the PHP 7.3 package and other required PHP extensions for PHP 7.3 for Ubuntu 18.04, you need to
use the well known, custom, PPA {ondrej-php-url}[ondrej/php]. Independent of the PHP version
used, all other items, such as installing extensions or comments, and notes, remain the same.

NOTE: If you are looking installing PHP 7.4, read the
xref:installation/manual_installation/server_prep_ubuntu_20.04.adoc[Ubuntu 20.04 preparation guide]
as it contains special notes and guides regaring PHP 7.4

== Apache Web Server and PHP

The following command installs the Apache web server and PHP.

[source,console]
----
sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php apache2
----

If you want to install in two steps, first PHP and then Apache, run the following commands:

[source,console]
----
sudo apt install php-cgi
sudo apt install php
sudo apt install apache2 libapache2-mod-php
----

Use `php-fpm` when opting for the FastCGI Process Manager. This requires a non-standard setup.

== Multiple Concurrent PHP Versions

If you have multiple concurrent PHP versions installed, which will happen when using `ondrej/php`,
you need to tell your Web Server and your CLI environment which one to use.
To list all available versions and choose one from them, use the following command:

[source,console]
----
sudo update-alternatives --config php
----
Here is an example output:

[source,console]
----
There are 2 choices for the alternative php (providing /usr/bin/php).

  Selection    Path             Priority   Status
------------------------------------------------------------
  0            /usr/bin/php7.4   74        auto mode
* 1            /usr/bin/php7.3   73        manual mode
  2            /usr/bin/php7.4   74        manual mode

Press <enter> to keep the current choice[*], or type selection number:
----

You can also directly set the required PHP version:

[source,console]
----
sudo update-alternatives --set php /usr/bin/php7.3
----

WARNING: Post selecting your PHP version, it is **highly** recommended to switch to the correct
compiling environment which is essential e.g. when using PECL!

[source,console]
----
sudo update-alternatives --set phar /usr/bin/phar7.3
sudo update-alternatives --set phar.phar /usr/bin/phar.phar7.3
sudo update-alternatives --set phpize /usr/bin/phpize7.3
sudo update-alternatives --set php-config /usr/bin/php-config7.3
----

When using Apache PHP-FPM, you have to configure your PHP version in an Apache config
file manually. In any case, the PHP version used must always be the same.

You can read more about the `update-alternatives` command on the {update-alternatives_url}[man page].

WARNING: When switching a PHP version, you MUST also configure the
corresponding php.ini files and modules used accordingly!

WARNING: You may get completely unexpected behaviour if the PHP version of the Web Server and
the CLI are different!

=== Avoiding a Nasty Pitfall

If you are using a PECL install later on, check the output of the command soon after it has
started. You will find text like:

[source,console]
----
...
PHP Api Version:         20190902
Zend Module Api No:      20190902
...
----

Then do a test by just entering the following command:

[source,console]
----
php -i | grep extension_dir
----

If the output is different in than the example below, there is a problem that needs fixing:

[source,console]
----
extension_dir => /usr/lib/php/20180731 => /usr/lib/php/20180731
----

This is the output that shows a fix is needed:

[source,console]
----
PHP Warning:  PHP Startup: smbclient: Unable to initialize module
Module compiled with module API=20190902
PHP    compiled with module API=20180731
These options need to match
----

As you see above, the API modules do not match and have been compiled with different versions
and therefore will not work. To fix this, uninstall the module with
`pecl uninstall <extension_name>` then set the correct `update-alternatives` as described above,
and reinstall it.

== Common Prerequisites

[source,console]
----
# Applications suggested for the use with ownCloud
sudo apt install smbclient
sudo apt install redis-server

# Applications needed for the use with ownCloud
sudo apt install unzip
sudo apt install openssl

# PHP extensions needed to use ownCloud
sudo apt install php-mysql php-mbstring php-gettext php-intl php-redis \
     php-imagick php-igbinary php-gmp php-bcmath php-curl php-gd php-zip \
     php-imap php-ldap php-bz2 php-ssh2 php-phpseclib
----

== Useful Commands For Managing PHP Extensions

=== List Enabled PHP Extensions

If you want to retrieve a list of enabled PHP extensions run following command:

[source,console]
----
ls `php -i | grep "^extension_dir" | sed -e 's/.*=> //'` | sort
----

=== Enabling and Disabling PHP Extensions

To enable or disable a PHP extension, use the commands `phpenmod` or `phpdismod`.

Example:
[source,console]
----
sudo phpenmod php-ldap
# or
sudo phpdismod php-ldap
----

== Exif Library

This library _should_ already be part of PHP 7.2.
However, you can check if it is by running the following command.

[source,console]
----
grep -q -P 'EXIF Support => enabled' <(php -i) && echo "Exif is installed and enabled"
----

== Notes for PHP Library phpseclib

phpseclib's BigInteger uses the php-gmp (GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library), php-bcmath and OpenSSL extensions,
if they're available, for speed, but doesn't require them to maintain maximum compatibility.
The GMP library uses an internal resource type, while the BCMath library uses strings as datatype.
The most salient difference is, that GMP works on [arbitrary precision] integer values, whereas BCMath
allows [arbitrary precision] decimal / float-like values.

== Cryptography Library

The sodium and OpenSSL PHP libraries are cryptographic libraries which are part of the PHP core from PHP 7.2 onwards.
Consequently, there is no need to install additional cryptographic libraries, such as php-libsodium or mcrypt.

[NOTE]
====
mcrypt was deprecated in PHP 7.2.
If you need it, it is still available via PECL.

mcrypt is only used if it's available.
If mcrypt is not available, either a pure-PHP implementation or OpenSSL is used instead.

The prioritization is as follows: OpenSSL > mcrypt > pure-PHP.
mcrypt and OpenSSL load faster than the pure-PHP implementation.
mcrypt offers a 45x speedup over pure-PHP.
OpenSSL offers a greater than 6.5x speedup over mcrypt.
====

=== Mcrypt PHP Library

Here are the steps for installing mcrypt, when it is explicitly required.

NOTE: Some steps were borrowed from the website for studentâ€™s
{mcrypt-link-url}[guide to installing the PHP 7.2-Mcrypt module].

First, determine the mcrypt version you want to use in {mcrypt-pecl-url}[PECL's mcrypt documentation].
Then, run the following commands to install it.

[source,console]
----
sudo apt install php-dev libmcrypt-dev php-pear
sudo pecl channel-update pecl.php.net
sudo pecl install mcrypt-<desired mcrypt version>
----

When the commands complete, you then have to:

* Create `/etc/php/7.2/mods-available/mcrypt.ini` with the following content: `extension=mcrypt.so`.
* Enable the module by running `phpenmod mcrypt`.
* Restart your web server, by running the following commands:
+
  sudo service apache2 restart

=== php-libsodium

NOTE: From PHP 7.2 onwards, libsodium is part of PHP, so installing this extension is no longer necessary.

If you see the message "_PHP Fatal error: sodium_init() in Unknown on line 0_" when invoking the command
`php -v` or when running PHP programs, php-libsodium may have been installed unnecessarily.
This error does not do any harm, but it can be annoying, and it fills up your logs.
To prevent this, you can uninstall php-libsodium.
This can be done by invoking the following command:

[source,console]
----
sudo apt remove php-libsodium
----

You can check success by invoking the command `php -v`, which should no longer return the error message.
You can also check the existence of sodium with the following command:

[source,console]
----
grep -P "sodium support => enabled" <( php -i )
----

== libsmbclient-php Library

`libsmbclient-php` is a PHP extension that uses Samba's libsmbclient library to provide
Samba-related functions to PHP programs. You need to install it, if you have installed
`smbclient` as described above. `smbclient` is e.g. necessary, if you are using the
xref:enterprise/external_storage/windows-network-drive_configuration.adoc[Windows Network Drives app]
from ownClouds Enterprise Edition. To install it, run the commands described below.
You can find more information about `smbclient` and the latest version on {pecl_url}[PECL].


[source,console]
----
sudo apt install php-dev libsmbclient-dev php-pear
sudo pecl channel-update pecl.php.net
sudo pecl install smbclient
----

When the commands complete, you then have to (assuming you use PHP 7.2):

- Create `/etc/php/7.2/mods-available/smbclient.ini` with following content `extension=smbclient.so`.
- Enable the module by running `phpenmod smbclient`.
- Restart PHP and your web server by running the following command:
+
  sudo service apache2 restart

NOTE: Do not get confused by the name `smbclient`. It is on the one hand a
{smbclient_url}[command-line SMB/CIFS client for Unix], and on the other hand the package
name for the PECL libsmbclient-php` PHP extension.

NOTE: Alternatively you can install it from {libsmbclient-php_url}[source].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Due to a change in the minimum protocol version used in the Samba client in **Ubuntu 18.04**,
you may not get a valid connection in ownCloud. This error is identified by a red box at the
mount definition or being unable to list directory content. In this case, you have to add the
following to `/etc/samba/smb.cnf`, below the `workgroup =` statement:

`client max protocol = NT1`

For more information see: {discover-samba-hosts-url}[Bionic Beaver can not discover Samba hosts]
