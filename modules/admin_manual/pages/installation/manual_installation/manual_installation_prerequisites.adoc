== Introduction

The ownCloud tar archive contains all of the required third-party PHP libraries.
As a result, no extra ones are, strictly, necessary.
However, ownCloud does require that PHP has a set of extensions installed, enabled, and configured.

This section lists both the required and optional PHP extensions.
If you need further information about a particular extension, please consult the relevant section of the {php-net-url}/manual/en/extensions.php[extensions section of the PHP manual].

If you are using a Linux distribution, it should have packages for all the required extensions.
You can check the presence of a module by typing `php -m | grep -i <module_name>`.
If you get a result, the module is present.

== Required Prerequisites

=== PHP Version

ownCloud can run with following PHP versions: {supported-php-versions}

[IMPORTANT]
====
ownCloud recommends PHP 7.4 for new installations.
Sites using a version earlier than PHP 7.3 are *strongly encouraged* to migrate at least to PHP 7.3.
