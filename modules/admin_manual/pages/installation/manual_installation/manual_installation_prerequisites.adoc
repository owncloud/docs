= Prerequisites for Manual Installation on Linux
:toc: right

== Introduction

The ownCloud tar archive contains all of the required third-party PHP libraries.
As a result, no extra ones are, strictly, necessary.
However, ownCloud does require that PHP has a set of extensions installed, enabled, and configured.

This section lists both the required and optional PHP extensions.
If you need further information about a particular extension, please consult the relevant section of http://php.net/manual/en/extensions.php[the extensions section of the PHP manual].

If you are using a Linux distribution, it should have packages for all the required extensions.
You can check the presence of a module by typing `php -m | grep -i <module_name>`.
If you get a result, the module is present.

== Required Prerequisites

=== PHP Version

ownCloud can run with following PHP versions: {supported-php-versions}

[IMPORTANT]
====
ownCloud recommends PHP 7.4 for new installations.
Sites using a version earlier than PHP 7.3 are *strongly encouraged* to migrate at least to PHP 7.3.

| Extension                                                   | Reason

|=======================================================================

NOTE: You don’t need the WebDAV module for your Web server (i.e., Apache’s `mod_webdav`), as ownCloud has a built-in WebDAV server of its own, http://sabre.io/[SabreDAV].
If `mod_webdav` is enabled you must disable it for ownCloud.
See xref:configure-apache-web-server[the Apache Web Server configuration] for an example configuration.

=== For MySQL/MariaDB

The InnoDB storage engine is required, and MyISAM is not supported, see xref:configuration/database/linux_database_configuration.adoc#mysql-mariadb-storage-engine[MySQL / MariaDB storage engine] for more information.
