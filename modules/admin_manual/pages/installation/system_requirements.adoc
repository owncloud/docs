If you use Ubuntu 16.04 and want to use PHP 7.x:

* PHP 7.1 and 7.2 are only available via PPA. 
  To add {ppa-guide-url}[a PPA (Personal Package Archive)] to your system, use this command: `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:user/ppa-name`.
* PHP 7.2 standard installable, but you have to install some mandatory modules yourself, such as 
{php-intl-ext-url}[intl].
====

[NOTE]

It is recommended to use *PHP {recommended-php-version}* as older versions have reached {php-supported-versions-url}[EOL] and will be deprecated for use with ownCloud Server in a future release.
