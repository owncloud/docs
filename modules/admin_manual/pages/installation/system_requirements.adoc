== Officially Supported Environments

For _best performance_, _stability_, _support_, and _full functionality_
we officially support:

=== Server

[cols="1,2a",options="header"]
|===
| Platform
| Options

| Operating System
|
* Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04
* Debian 8 and 9
* SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 with SP4 and 15
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux/Centos 7.5 and 8 (64-bit only)
* Fedora 28 and 29
* openSUSE Leap 42.3 and 15

| Database
|
* MySQL 8+ or MariaDB 10+ (RECOMMENDED)
* Oracle 11 and 12
* PostgreSQL 9 (versions 10 and above are not _yet_ supported)
* SQLite (NOT FOR PRODUCTION)

| Web server
| * Apache 2.4 with xref:installation/manual_installation.adoc#multi-processing-module-mpm[`prefork` and `mod_php`]

| PHP Runtime
| * {supported-php-versions}
|===

[NOTE]
====
For Linux distributions, we support, if technically feasible, the latest two versions per platform and the previous LTS Version.
====

== Database Requirements

The following database settings are currently required if you’re running ownCloud together
with a MySQL or MariaDB database:

* Disabled or `BINLOG_FORMAT = MIXED` or `BINLOG_FORMAT = ROW` configured Binary Logging (See: xref:configuration/database/linux_database_configuration.adoc#mysql-mariadb-with-binary-logging-enabled[MySQL / MariaDB with Binary Logging Enabled])
* InnoDB storage engine (The MyISAM storage engine is not supported, see:
xref:configuration/database/linux_database_configuration.adoc#mysql-mariadb-storage-engine[MySQL / MariaDB storage engine])
* `READ COMMITED` transaction isolation level (See: 
xref:configuration/database/linux_database_configuration.adoc#mysql-mariadb-read-commited-transaction-isolation-level[MySQL / MariaDB `READ COMMITED` transaction isolation level])

== Memory Requirements

Memory requirements for running an ownCloud server are greatly variable,
depending on the numbers of users and files, and volume of server
activity. ownCloud officially requires a minimum of 128MB RAM. But, we
recommend a minimum of 512MB.

=== Hypervisors

* Hyper-V
* VMware ESX
* Xen
* KVM

=== Mobile OS

* iOS 9.0+
* Android 4.4+

=== Web Browser

* Edge (current version on Windows 10)
* IE11 or newer (except Compatibility Mode)
* Firefox 60 ESR+
* Chrome 66+
* Safari 10+

=== Client Operating System

=== Sync Clients and Mobile Apps 

We always recommend to use the newest clients and mobile apps with the latest server release.

[NOTE]
.Consideration for low memory environments
====
Scanning of files is committed internally in 10k files chunks.
Based on tests, server memory usage for scanning greater than 10k files uses about 75MB of additional memory.
