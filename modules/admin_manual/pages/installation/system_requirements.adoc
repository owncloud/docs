== Database Requirements

The following database settings are currently required if youâ€™re running ownCloud together with a MySQL or MariaDB database:

* Disabled or `BINLOG_FORMAT = MIXED` or `BINLOG_FORMAT = ROW` configured Binary Logging (See: xref:configuration/database/linux_database_configuration.adoc#mysql-mariadb[MySQL / MariaDB with Binary Logging Enabled])
* InnoDB storage engine (The MyISAM storage engine is *not supported*, see:
xref:configuration/database/linux_database_configuration.adoc#mysql-mariadb[MySQL / MariaDB storage engine])
* `READ COMMITTED` transaction isolation level (See:
xref:configuration/database/linux_database_configuration.adoc#set-read-committed-as-the-transaction-isolation-level[MySQL / MariaDB `READ COMMITTED` transaction isolation level])

== Memory Requirements

Memory requirements for running an ownCloud server are greatly variable, depending on the numbers of users and files, and volume of server activity. ownCloud officially requires a minimum of 128MB RAM.
But, we recommend a minimum of 512MB.
