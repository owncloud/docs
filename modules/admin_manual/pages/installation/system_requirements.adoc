  To add {ppa-guide-url}[a PPA (Personal Package Archive)] to your system, use this command: `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:user/ppa-name`.
* PHP 7.2 standard installable, but you have to install some mandatory modules yourself, such as 
{php-intl-ext-url}[intl].
====

[NOTE]
====
It is recommended to use *PHP {recommended-php-version}* as older versions have reached {php-supported-versions-url}[EOL] and will be deprecated for use with ownCloud Server in a future release.
====

[NOTE]

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux & Centos 7 are 64-bit only.
* Oracle 11g is only supported for the Enterprise edition.

If you are not able to use one or more of the above tools, the following

=== Web Server

* NGINX with PHP-FPM

[[memory-requirements]]
== Memory Requirements

Memory requirements for running an ownCloud server are greatly variable,
depending on the numbers of users and files, and volume of server
activity. ownCloud officially requires a minimum of 128MB RAM. But, we
recommend a minimum of 512MB.

[NOTE]
.Consideration for low memory environments
====
Scanning of files is committed internally in 10k files chunks.
Based on tests, server memory usage for scanning greater than 10k files uses about 75MB of additional memory.
====

[[database-requirements]]
== Database Requirements

The following are currently required if you’re running ownCloud together
with a MySQL or MariaDB database:

* Disabled or `BINLOG_FORMAT = MIXED` or `BINLOG_FORMAT = ROW` configured Binary Logging (See: xref:configuration/database/linux_database_configuration.adoc#mysql-mariadb-with-binary-logging-enabled[MySQL / MariaDB with Binary Logging Enabled])
* InnoDB storage engine (The MyISAM storage engine is not supported, see:
xref:configuration/database/linux_database_configuration.adoc#mysql-mariadb-storage-engine[MySQL / MariaDB storage engine])
* `READ COMMITED` transaction isolation level (See: 
xref:configuration/database/linux_database_configuration.adoc#mysql-mariadb-read-commited-transaction-isolation-level[MySQL / MariaDB `READ COMMITED` transaction isolation level])
