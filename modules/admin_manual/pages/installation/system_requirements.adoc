== Database Requirements

The following database settings are currently required if youâ€™re running ownCloud together
with a MySQL or MariaDB database:

* Disabled or `BINLOG_FORMAT = MIXED` or `BINLOG_FORMAT = ROW` configured Binary Logging (See: xref:configuration/database/linux_database_configuration.adoc#mysql-mariadb-with-binary-logging-enabled[MySQL / MariaDB with Binary Logging Enabled])
* InnoDB storage engine (The MyISAM storage engine is not supported, see:
xref:configuration/database/linux_database_configuration.adoc#mysql-mariadb-storage-engine[MySQL / MariaDB storage engine])
* `READ COMMITED` transaction isolation level (See: 
xref:configuration/database/linux_database_configuration.adoc#mysql-mariadb-read-commited-transaction-isolation-level[MySQL / MariaDB `READ COMMITED` transaction isolation level])

== Memory Requirements

Memory requirements for running an ownCloud server are greatly variable, depending on the numbers of users and files, and volume of server activity. ownCloud officially requires a minimum of 128MB RAM. 
But, we recommend a minimum of 512MB.
