== Introduction

After installing ownCloud, you may provide added functionality by installing applications.

== Installing and Managing Apps

=== Installing Apps Via the ownCloud Marketplace

image:installation/top_menu_showing_market_app.png[ownCloud top navigation menu showing the Market app]

To add an app, use the _Market_ app, which is accessible from the top-level navigation bar, on the left-hand side of the page. 
Once in the Market app, click an app's name to view more details about it.
Once you have done this, you can also install it by clicking btn:[Install]. 
Clicking _Install_, downloads it from the ownCloud Marketplace, installs, and enables it.

Sometimes the installation of a third-party app fails silently, possibly because `appcodechecker' => true,` is enabled in `config.php`. 
When `appcodechecker` is enabled, it checks if third-party apps are using the private API, rather than the public API. 
If they are, they are not installed.

NOTE: If you would like to create or add (your own) ownCloud app, please refer to the xref:developer_manual:app/introduction.adoc[developer manual].

=== Installing Apps Manually

To install an app manually, instead of by using the Market app, extract the app tarball into your ownCloud installation's default app folder (`</path/to/owncloud>/apps`) or, ideally,  into xref:using-custom-app-directories[a custom app directory].

Once the tarball has been extracted into place:

. Enable the app via either:
** Navigating to menu:Settings[Admin > Apps] and clicking btn:[Enable]; or 
** Using xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#app-command[the occ app command].

=== Managing Apps

Some apps are installed and enabled during ownCloud installation, while other apps can be installed and enabled post-installation. 

[NOTE]
====
*Supported Enterprise Apps*

See xref:installation/apps_supported.adoc[supported apps] for a list of supported Enterprise edition apps.

==== View App Status

To see the status of your installation's applications, go to your Apps page, via menu:Settings[Admin > Apps].
There, you will see which apps are currently: _enabled_, _not enabled_, and _recommended_. 
You'll also see additional filters, such as _Multimedia_, _Productivity_, and _Tool_ for finding more apps quickly.

==== Enabling and Disabling Apps

On the Apps page (menu:Settings[Admin > Apps]), you can enable or disable applications. 
Be default, enabled apps are displayed. 
To disable an app, click btn:[Disable] under its details.

To display disabled apps, click btn:[Show disabled apps].
To enable an app, click btn:[Enable] under its details.

==== Configuring Apps

Some apps have configurable options on the Apps page, such as *Enable only for specific groups*. 
However, this is the exception.
Apps are mainly configured from your ownCloud Personal or Admin settings page, or in `config.php`.

== Using Custom App Directories

There are several reasons for using custom app directories instead of ownCloud's default. 
These are:

. It separates ownCloud's core apps from user or admin downloaded apps. 
Doing so distinguishes which apps are core and which aren't, simplifying upgrades.
. It eases manual upgrades. 
Having non-core apps in a directory separate to the core app directory makes them simpler to manage.
. ownCloud may gain new core apps in newer versions. 
Doing so orphans deprecated apps, but doesn't remove them.

If you want to store apps in a custom directory, instead of ownCloud's default (`/app`), you need to modify the `apps_paths` element in `config/config.php`. 
There, you need to add a new associative array that contains three elements. 
These are:

`path`:: The absolute file system path to the custom app folder.
`url`:: The request path to that folder relative to the ownCloud webroot, prefixed with `/`.
`writable`:: Whether users can install apps in that folder. 

After adding the configuration, ownCloud only installs apps in directories where `writable` is set to `true`.
The configuration example below shows how to add a second directory, called `apps-external`.

After you add a new directory configuration, you can then move apps from the original app directory to the new one. 
To do so, follow these steps:

. xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#maintenance-commands[Enable maintenance mode].
. xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#apps-commands[Disable the apps] that you want to move.
. Create a new apps directory and assign it the same user and group, and ownership permissions as the core apps directory.
. Move the apps from the old apps directory to the new apps directory.
. Add a new app directory in `config/config.php`.
. If youâ€™re using a cache, such as xref:configuration/server/caching_configuration.adoc#clearing-the-redis-cache[Redis] or xref:configuration/server/caching_configuration.adoc#clearing-the-memcached-cache[Memcached], ensure that you clear the cache.
