= Installing and Managing Apps
:toc: right

== Introduction

After installing ownCloud, you may provide added functionality by installing applications.

== Supported Apps

See xref:installation/apps_supported.adoc[supported apps] for a list of supported Enterprise edition apps.

== Viewing Enabled Apps

During the ownCloud installation, some apps are installed and enabled by
default, and some are able to be installed and enabled later on. To see
the status of your installation’s applications, go to your Apps page.

image:oc_admin_apps.png[Apps page for enabling and disabling apps.]

There, you will see which apps are currently: _enabled_, _not enabled_,
and _recommended_. You’ll also see additional filters, such as
Multimedia, Productivity, and Tool for finding more apps quickly.

== Managing Apps

In the Apps page, you can enable or disable applications. Some apps have
configurable options on the Apps page, such as *Enable only for specific
groups*, but mainly they are enabled or disabled here and are configured
on your ownCloud _Admin page_, _Personal page_, or in `config.php`.

== Adding Apps

Click the app name to view a description of the app and any of the app
settings in the Application View field. Clicking the *Install* button
installs the app. If the app is not part of your ownCloud installation,
it will be downloaded from the ownCloud Marketplace, installed, and
enabled.

Sometimes the installation of a third-party app fails silently, possibly
because `'appcodechecker' => true,` is enabled in `config.php`. When
`appcodechecker` is enabled it checks if third-party apps are using the
private API, rather than the public API. If they are, then they will not
be installed.

NOTE: If you would like to create or add your own ownCloud app, please
refer to the xref:developer_manual:app/introduction.adoc[developer manual].

== Using Custom App Directories

There are several reasons for using custom app directories instead of
ownCloud’s default. These are:

1.  It separates ownCloud’s core apps from user or admin downloaded
apps. Doing so distinguishes which apps are core and which aren’t,
simplifying upgrades.
2.  It eases manual upgrades. Downloaded apps must be manually copied.
Having them in a separate directory makes it simpler to manage.
3.  ownCloud may gain new core apps in newer versions. Doing so orphans
deprecated apps, but doesn’t remove them.

If you want to store apps in a custom directory, instead of ownCloud’s
default (`/app`), you need to modify the `apps_paths` element in
`config/config.php`. There, you need to add a new associative array that
contains three elements. These are:

* `path`: The absolute file system path to the custom app folder.
* `url`: The request path to that folder relative to the ownCloud web
root, prefixed with `/`.
* `writable`: Whether users can install apps in that folder. After the
configuration is added, new apps will only install in a directory where
`writable` is set to `true`.

The configuration example below shows how to add a second directory,
called `apps-external`.

After you add a new directory configuration, you can then move apps from
the original app directory to the new one. To do so, follow these steps:

1.  xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#maintenance-commands[Enable maintenance mode].
2.  xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#apps-commands[Disable the apps] that you want to move.
3.  Create a new apps directory and assign it the same user and group,
and ownership permissions as the core apps directory.
4.  Move the apps from the old apps directory to the new apps directory.
5.  Add a new app directory in `config/config.php`.
6.  If you’re using a cache, such as xref:configuration/server/caching_configuration.adoc#clearing-the-redis-cache[Redis] or xref:configuration/server/caching_configuration.adoc#clearing-the-memcached-cache[Memcached], ensure that you clear the cache.
7.  Re-enable the apps.
8.  Disable maintenance mode.

== Manually Installing Apps

To install an app manually instead of by using https://marketplace.owncloud.com[the Marketplace], copy the app either into ownCloud’s default app folder (`</path/to/owncloud>/apps`) or xref:using-custom-app-directories[a custom app folder].

Be aware that the name of the app and its folder name *must be
identical*! You can find these details in
the application's metadata file, located in
`<app directory>/appinfo/info.xml`.

Using the example below, both the app’s name and directory name would be
`yourappname`.
