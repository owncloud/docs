== Introduction

IMPORTANT: If you are planning to use the installation wizard, we *strongly* encourage you to protect it, 
through some form of {passwbasicauth_url}[password authentication], or {access_control_url}[access control].
If the installer is left unprotected when exposed to the public internet, there is the possibility that a 
malicious actor could finish the installation and block you out — or worse. 
So please ensure that only you — or someone from your organization — can access the web installer.

== Quick Start

When the ownCloud prerequisites are fulfilled and all ownCloud files are
installed, the last step to completing the installation is running the
Installation Wizard. This involves just three steps:

1.  Point your web browser to `\http://<your-owncloud-domain>`
2.  Enter your desired administrator’s username and password
3.  Click btn:[Finish Setup]

You’re now finished and can start using your new ownCloud server. Of course,
there is much more that you _can_ do to set up your ownCloud server for best
performance and security. In the following sections we will cover important
installation and post-installation steps.

== Detailed Guide

This section provides a more detailed guide to the installation wizard.
Specifically, it is broken down into three steps:

1. xref:installation-configuration-options[Installation Configuration Options]
2. xref:database-setup-by-owncloud[Database Setup By ownCloud]
3. xref:post-installation-steps[Post-Installation Steps]

=== Installation Configuration Options

Click btn:[Storage and Database] to expose additional installation
configuration options for your ownCloud data directory and to select the database
respectively configure the access.

The data directory for ownCloud can be configured to be outside of your webroot.
This can be done in two ways. Either by defining the path here or when installing
the ownCloud files - see the
xref:installation/manual_installation/script_guided_install.adoc[Script Guided Installation].
When defining here, a setting in your config.php file will be adopted. When e.g. linking
during installing the physical files, the config.php setting regarding the data directory
stays default.

IMPORTANT: ownCloud’s data directory *must be exclusive to ownCloud* and not
be modified manually by any other process or user.

It is best to configure your data directory location at installation, as
it is difficult to move after installation. You may put it anywhere; in this
example is it located in `/var/oc_data`. This directory must already exist,
and must be owned by your Webserver user user.

=== Database Setup By ownCloud

IMPORTANT: Your database and PHP connectors must be installed **before** you
run the Installation Wizard.

After you enter your administrative login for your database, the installer
creates a special database user with privileges limited to the ownCloud database.

Following this, ownCloud needs only this special ownCloud database user
and drops the aministrative database login you used before. This new user
is named from your ownCloud admin user, with an `oc_` prefix, and given a
random password. The ownCloud database user and password are written into
`config.php`:

For MySQL/MariaDB:

----
'dbuser' => 'oc_dbadmin',
'dbpassword' => 'pX65Ty5DrHQkYPE5HRsDvyFHlZZHcm',
----

For PostgreSQL:

----
'dbuser' => 'oc_postgres',
'dbpassword' => 'pX65Ty5DrHQkYPE5HRsDvyFHlZZHcm',
----

Click btn:[Finish setup], and you’re ready to start using your new ownCloud server.

=== Post-Installation Steps

For hardened security ownCloud recommends setting the permissions on your
ownCloud directories as strictly as possible, and for proper server operations.
This should be done immediately after the initial installation and
before running the setup.

Your HTTP user must own the `config/`, `data/`, `apps/` respectively the
`apps-external/` directories so that you can configure ownCloud, create,
modify and delete your data files, and install apps via the ownCloud Web
interface.

You can find your HTTP user in your HTTP server configuration files, or
you can use label-phpinfo (Look for the *User/Group* line).

* The HTTP user and group in Debian/Ubuntu is `www-data`.
* The HTTP user and group in Fedora/CentOS is `apache`.
* The HTTP user and group in Arch Linux is `http`.
* The HTTP user in openSUSE is `wwwrun`, and the HTTP group is `www`.

NOTE: When using an NFS mount for the data directory, do not change its ownership from the default. 
The simple act of mounting the drive will set proper permissions for ownCloud to write to the directory. 
Changing ownership as above could result in some issues if the NFS mount is lost.

The easy way to set the correct permissions is to use the scripts provided in
xref:installation/manual_installation/script_guided_install.adoc[Script Guided Installation]
