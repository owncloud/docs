== Introduction

IMPORTANT: If you are planning to use the installation wizard, we *strongly* encourage you to protect it 
through some form of {passwbasicauth_url}[password authentication] or {access_control_url}[access control].
If the installer is left unprotected when exposed to the internet, there is the possibility that a 
malicious actor could finish the installation and block you out — or worse. 
So please ensure that only you — or someone from your organization — can access the web installer.

== Quick Start

When the ownCloud prerequisites are fulfilled and all ownCloud files are
installed, run the Installation Wizard. This involves just three steps:

1.  Point your web browser to `\http://<your-owncloud-domain>`.
2.  Enter your desired administrator’s username and password.
3.  Click btn:[Finish Setup].

You’re now finished and can start using your new ownCloud server. Of course,
there is much more that you _can_ do to set up your ownCloud server for best
performance and security. In the following sections we will cover important
installation and post-installation steps.

== Detailed Guide

This section provides a more detailed guide to the installation wizard and the three main topics:

1. xref:post-installation-steps[Post-Installation Steps]
2. xref:installation-configuration-options[Configuration Options]
3. xref:database-setup-by-owncloud[Database Setup by ownCloud]

=== Post-Installation Steps

For hardened security and proper server operation, ownCloud recommends setting the permissions on your
ownCloud directories as strictly as possible. 
This should be done immediately after the initial installation and
before running the setup.

Your HTTP user must own the directories `config/`, `data/`, `apps/` and, if applicable, 
`apps-external/` so that you can configure ownCloud, create,
modify and delete your data files and install apps via the ownCloud Web
interface.

You can find your HTTP user in your HTTP server configuration files, or
you can use label-phpinfo. Look for the *User/Group* line.

* The HTTP user and group in Debian/Ubuntu is `www-data`.
* The HTTP user and group in Fedora/CentOS is `apache`.
* The HTTP user and group in Arch Linux is `http`.
* The HTTP user in openSUSE is `wwwrun`, and the HTTP group is `www`.

NOTE: When using an NFS mount for the data directory, do not change its ownership from the default. 
The simple act of mounting the drive will set proper permissions for ownCloud to write to the directory. 
Changing ownership could cause problems if the NFS mount is lost.

An easy way to set the correct permissions is to use the scripts provided in the
xref:installation/manual_installation/script_guided_install.adoc[Script Guided Installation].

=== Configuration Options

Click btn:[Storage and Database] to expose additional installation
configuration options for your ownCloud data directory and to select the database
and configure the access.

image:installation/install-wizard-a1.jpg[Installation Configuration Options, width=50%]

CAUTION: For security reasons, the `data` directory of your ownCloud should be located outside the webroot of your server.

The location of the `data` directory can either be defined by entering the path here or when installing
the ownCloud files. For more information on the latter, see the
xref:installation/manual_installation/script_guided_install.adoc[Script Guided Installation].

If you define the path here, the respective setting in your config.php file will be adjusted. Alternatively, you can create a link `data` pointing to the directory containing the actual files. In this case, the config.php setting for the data directory remains unchanged.

IMPORTANT: ownCloud’s data directory *must be exclusive to ownCloud* and not
be modified manually by any other process or user.

It is best to configure your data directory location at installation, as
it is difficult to move after installation. You may put it anywhere; in this
example is it located in `/var/oc_data`. This directory must already exist
and must be owned by your webserver user.

=== Database Setup by ownCloud

IMPORTANT: Your database and PHP connectors must be installed **before** you
run the Installation Wizard.

After you enter your administrative login for your database, the installer
creates a special database user with privileges limited to the ownCloud database.

Afterward, ownCloud only needs this special ownCloud database user
and drops the administrative database login you used before. This new user's name
is based on your ownCloud admin user with an `oc_` prefix and given a
random password. The ownCloud database user and password are written into
`config.php`:

For MySQL/MariaDB:

----
'dbuser' => 'oc_dbadmin',
'dbpassword' => 'pX65Ty5DrHQkYPE5HRsDvyFHlZZHcm',
----

For PostgreSQL:

----
'dbuser' => 'oc_postgres',
'dbpassword' => 'pX65Ty5DrHQkYPE5HRsDvyFHlZZHcm',
----

Click btn:[Finish setup], and you’re ready to start using your new ownCloud server.
