ownCloud recommends using NFS for any scenario other than local storage. 
It has solid performance and is very stable.
This document contains ownCloud's official deployment recommendations.

There can be different scenarios where ownCloud's storage is located on an NFS mount (primary/secondary).
In some scenarios, multiple application servers can use the same NFS mount point.

NOTE: It is advised to use network storage like NFS only in un-routed, switched Gigabit or higher environments.

NOTE: This guide only covers the NFS client side where ownCloud runs. Follow the storage vendors recommendations to configure the NFS server (storage backend).

== General Performance Considerations

Please consider that a network stack runs in ranges of µs while a storage backend usually runs in ranges of ms.
Any tuning considerations should therefore first be attempted on the backend storage layout side, especially under high loads.

|===

== NFSv4

ownCloud recommends using NFSv4 over previous versions for a number of key reasons.
These are:

* *Improved Security:* It {nfs-strong-security-architecture-url}[mandates a strong security architecture]. It does not require {rpc-statd-url}[rpc.statd] or {lockd-url}[lockd]. As a result, it only uses port 2049.
* *Improved Reliability:* Uses TCP by default.
* *Improved Performance:* It uses Multi-Component Messages, which reduce network traffic. It is capable of using a 32KB page size, compared to the default, 1024 bytes.
* Use of {nfs-read-write-delegations-url}[Read/Write Delegations].

== NFS Mount Options

Please see the {man-nfs-ubuntu-url}[Ubuntu man pages] for a detailed description of the NFS mount options. 

Dependent on the NFS version used, consider following mount options:

=== _netdev

Use this option to ensure that the network is enabled, before NFS attempts to mount these filesystem.
This setting is essential when database files are located on an NFS storage.
The database could error or not start correctly, if the mount is not ready before attempting to access its data files.

TIP: You can also use {autofs-url}[autofs], to ensure that mounts are always available before attempting to access them.

=== bg

ownCloud recommends using this option.
Determines how the mount command behaves if an attempt to mount an export fails.
If the bg option is specified, a timeout or failure triggers the mount command to fork a child, which will continue to attempt mounting the export. 
The parent immediately returns with a zero exit code. 
This is known as a "background" mount.
This option is useful for continuous operation without manual intervention if the network connectivity is temporarily down or the storage backend must be rebooted.

=== hard

Default value is _hard_.
For business-critical NFS exports, ownCloud recommends using _hard_ mounts. 
ownCloud strongly discourages the use of _soft_ mounts. 

=== retrans

Default value is 3. 
This option can be tuned when using option _soft_.

=== timeo

Default value is 600 (60 seconds). 
This option can be tuned when using option _soft_.

=== sync/async

With the default value of _async_, the NFS client may delay sending application writes to the NFS server.
In other words, under normal circumstances, data written by an application may not immediately appear on the server that hosts the file.
**sync** provides greater data cache coherence among clients, but at a **significant performance cost**.
Having the database like MySQL or Mariadb on NFS, the default database option value for {innodb_flush_method-url}[innodb_flush_method] is _fsync_, even if it is not explicitly set.
This database option forces the mount to immediately write to the NFS server without generally setting the mount _sync_ option and avoiding this performance penalty.
You may consider further tuning when using clustederd server environments.

=== tcp

ownCloud recommends using this option.
Force using TCP as transport protocol. 
Alternatively you can use _proto=tcp_.

=== Tune the Read and Write Block Sizes

The allowed block sizes are the packet chunk sizes that NFS uses when reading and writing data.
The smaller the size, the greater the number of packets need to be sent to send or receive a file.
Conversely, the larger the size, the fewer the number of packets need to be sent to send or receive a file.
With NFS Version 3 and 4, you can set the `rsize` and `wsize` values as high as 65536, when the network transport is TCP.
The default value is 32768 and must be a multiple of 4096.

NOTE: Read and write size must be identical on the NFS server and client.

You can find the set values by working with the output of the `mount` command on a standard server, as in the example below.

[source,console]
----
#root@server:~# mount | egrep -o rsize=[0-9]*
rsize=65536

#root@server:~# mount | egrep -o wsize=[0-9]*
wsize=65536
----

The information can also be retrieved using the command set of your dedicated storage backend.
Once you've determined the best sizes, set them permanently by passing the (`rsize` and `wsize`) options when mounting the share or in the share's mount configuration.

.Specifying the read and write block sizes when calling mount
[source, console]
----
mount 192.168.0.104:/data  /mnt -o rsize=65536,wsize=65536
----

.Example for a set of NFS mount options:
[source, console]
----
bg,nfsvers=3,wsize=65536,rsize=65536,tcp,_netdev
----

== Ethernet Configuration Options
 
=== MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) Size

The MTU size dictates the maximum amount of data that can be transferred in one Ethernet frame.
If the MTU size is too small, then regardless of the read and write block sizes, the data must still be fragmented across multiple frames.
Keep in mind that MTU = payload (`packetsize`) + 28.

==== Get the Current Set MTU Size

You can find the current MTU size for each interface using _netstat_, _ifconfig_, _ip_, and _cat_, as in the following examples:

.Retrieve interface MTU size with netstat
[source,console]
----
netstat -i

Kernel Interface table
Iface      MTU    RX-OK RX-ERR RX-DRP RX-OVR    TX-OK TX-ERR TX-DRP TX-OVR Flg
lo       65536   363183      0      0 0        363183      0      0      0 LRU
eth0      1500  3138292      0      0 0       2049155      0      0      0 BMR
----

.Retrieve interface MTU size with ifconfig
[source,console]
----
ifconfig| grep -i MTU

lo: flags=73<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING>  mtu 65536
eth0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
----

.Retrieve interface MTU size with ip
[source,console]
----
ip addr | grep mtu

1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
----

.Retrieve interface MTU size with cat
[source,console]
----
cat /sys/class/net/<interface>/mtu
----

==== Check for MTU Fragmentation

To check if a particular packet size will be fragmented on the way to the target, run the following command:

[source, console]
----
ping <your-storage-backend> -c 3 -M do -s <packetsize>
----

==== Get the Optimal MTU Size

To get the optimal MTU size, run following command:

[source, console]
----
tracepath <your-storage-backend>
----

You can expect to see output like the following:

[source, console]
----
 1?: [LOCALHOST]                      pmtu 1500 <1>
 1:  <your-storage-backend>                              0.263ms reached <2>
 1:  <your-storage-backend>                              0.224ms reached <3>
     Resume: pmtu 1500 hops 1 back 1
----
<1> The first line with localhost shows the given MTS size.
<2> The last line shows the optimal MTU size.
<3> If both are identical, nothing needs to be done.

==== Change Your MTU Value

In case you need or want to change the MTU size, under Ubuntu:

* If {networkmanager-url}[NetworkManager] is managing all devices on the system, then you can use {nmtui-url}[nmtui] or {nmcli-url}[nmcli] to configure the MTU setting.
* If NetworkManager is not managing all devices on the system, you can set the MTU to 1280 with Netplan, as in the following example.
+
[source,yaml]
----
network:
  version: 2
  ethernets:
    eth0:
      mtu: 1280
----
+
Refer to {netplan-docs-url}[the Netplan documentation] for further information.

TIP: NetworkWorld has {networkworld-mtu-size-issues-url}[an excellent overview of MTU size issues].
