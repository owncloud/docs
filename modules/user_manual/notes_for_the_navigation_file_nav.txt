The navigation files have been relocated and are accessed differently now.

The main nav.adoc file is in ROOT and includes all nav.adoc files from the modules. To do so, the modules nav.adoc files needed to be relocated from:

{modulesdir}/nav.adoc
to
{modulesdir}/partials/nav.adoc

This is due to the fact that "Antora does not classify files located at the root of the module or in the modules folder" which means, there is no access path to a nav.adoc file which is located in the root of a module.

As a result, the antora.yml file only contains the main ROOT/nav.adoc file.

This is benificial, as we now can structure products and their content in a better way.
