= Public Link Shares
:experimental:

With ownCloud X (10.0), we introduced the ability to create multiple public links per file or folder. 
This offers a lot of flexibility for creating different kinds of share links for a single file or folder, such as _different passwords_, _expiry dates_, and _permissions_.

As of ownCloud version 10.0.2 you can xref:files/webgui/sharing.adoc#creating-drop-folders[create Drop Folders], where users can upload files to a central location, but not be able to change any existing ones, nor see other files which already have been uploaded.

== Creating Public Link Shares

To create a public link share, first view the Sharing Panel of the file or folder that you want to create a public link share for. 
Then, click the btn:[Public Links] button, and then click btn:[Create public link].
After you do, the public link share dialog will appear, which you can see below.

As with other shares, provide the name in the *"Link Name"* field, and fill out the options that suit what you want the link to support. 
You can find details of what each option does below.

Finally, click the btn:[Save] button to complete creation of the share. 
Now that the share is created, you can:

* Copy the link to the share and give it out
* Update the shareâ€™s settings
* Share the link via social media and email
* Delete the public link
