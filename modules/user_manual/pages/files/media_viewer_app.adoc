== Introduction

The {media-viewer-app-url}[Media Viewer app] is a lightweight viewer for pictures and videos which integrates with the files app, and is released under the GPLv2. 
It replaces the gallery and files_videoplayer apps, which have now been deprecated, and supports the same basic feature set as the deprecated apps.

It supports the following functionality:

* *Image*: _preview_, _zoom_, _rotation_, and _download_
* *Video*: _playback_ and _download_

NOTE: The app will support paginating through all media files in the current directory, even if only one media file was chosen to be previewed.

== Features

* Support for a large selection of image and video formats (depending on server setup)
* Fullscreen, zoomable slideshow view integrated with the Files view and Public Links
* Image rotation
* Sort images by name or date
* Image and video download straight from the slideshow
* Native SVG support
* Mobile support

== Supported File Formats

* The supported video formats depend on the user's browser. However, the app supports _MP4_, _Ogg_, and _WebM_.
* The supported image formats depend on the server capabilities
