== Introduction

You can access your files with the ownCloud Web interface, as well as:
_create_, _preview_, _edit_, _delete_, _share_, and _re-share_ files.

IMPORTANT: Your ownCloud administrator has the option to disable these features. If any of them are missing on your system ask your server administrator.

[[display-file-details]]
==== Display File Details

When you display details about a file, by clicking btn:[Details] in the
Overflow Menu, a set of tabs (or views) are available. These are:

[cols="15%,70%",options="header",]
|======================================================================
| View | Description
| Details | This shows details about a file, such as its name, size,
 and when it was created or last updated.
| Activity | This shows a history of activity on the file, such as when
 it was created, updated, and shared.
| Sharing | It’s here that shares are managed. To know more, refer to
 the xref:sharing-files[Sharing Files] section.

 not available for folders.
