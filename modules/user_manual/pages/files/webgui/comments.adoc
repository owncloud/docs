== Introduction

In ownCloud, you can add one or more comments on both files and folders.
This section describes how to add, edit, and delete comments.

[[add-comments]]
== Add Comments

Use the Details view, in xref:files/webgui/overview.adoc#the-overflow-menu[The Overflow Menu], 
to add and read comments on any file or folder. Comments are visible to
everyone who has access to the file or folder. To add a comment, as in
the example below, click the btn:[Comments] tab in the Details view, write a
comment in the New Comment field, and click btn:[Post].

[[edit-comments]]
== Edit Comments

To edit an existing comment on a file or folder, hover the mouse over
the comment and you will see a pencil icon appear. By clicking on the
pencil, the btn:[Edit Comment] field will appear, pre-filled with the
comment text. Change the text as necessary and click btn:[Save].
If you change your mind, just click btn:[Cancel].

[[delete-comments]]
== Delete Comments

To delete an existing comment on a file or folder, as with editing
comments, hover the mouse over the comment and you will see a pencil
icon appear. Click the pencil, and a rubbish bin icon appears on the far
right-hand side of the comment author’s name, above the btn:[Edit Comment]
text field. Click the btn:[rubbish bin], and the comment will be deleted after a few seconds.
