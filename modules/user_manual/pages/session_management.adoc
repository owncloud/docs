== Introduction

The personal settings page allows you to have an overview of the connected browsers and clients.
It is accessed by selecting the menu:Settings[Personal > Security].

[[sessions]]
== Sessions

The sessions list shows which browsers and clients were recently, and are actively connected to your ownCloud installation. 
You can use the trash icon, at the far right-hand side of any session, to terminate it. 

*Please Be Aware of Two Things*

. If you want to lock out a user, you need to change their password *before* you terminate their session. 
. The currently logged-in user cannot terminate their own session from the sessions list.

[[app-passwords]]
== App Passswords

Underneath the "_App passwords / tokens_" list is a button to create a new app or device-specific username and password. 
The username will be pre-filled to the currently logged in user, and a random password will be generated. 
You can change both of these, if so desired. 
When you're happy with the username and password, click the btn:[done] button.
You can use the trash icon, at the far right-hand side of any password, to delete it 


IMPORTANT: Once the password / token is created, *it cannot be changed*; it can only be deleted.

TIP: We recommend that you generate tokens for every device you want to connect to your ownCloud instance, as this will allow you to disconnect connections individually, if necessary.
