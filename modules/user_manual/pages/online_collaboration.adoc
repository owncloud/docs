== Collabora Online

{collabora-online-url}[Collabora Online] is a powerful {libreoffice-url}[LibreOffice]-based online office that supports all major document, spreadsheet and presentation file formats, and is integrable with ownCloud. 

=== Secure View

Secure View is a way to securely distribute information, without that information being able to leave your organisation.
It provides the ability to restrict access to documents, in _read-only_ shares, so that recipients cannot copy, download, or edit shared files.

When enabled, documents will be viewed through Collabora Online with a watermark.
In addition, the ability to print and export files (with watermarks) is available, once Secure View is enabled.

NOTE: This feature is *not* available in the community edition, or for Public Links.

==== How to Use Secure View

image::enterprise/collaboration/secure-view/collabora-online-administration.png[Configure Secure View in ownCloud Server.,align="center"]

To enable Secure View for an existing, or new, share: 

* enable btn:[{secure-view-label}]
* enable btn:[can print / export PDF] (_optional_). This allows documents to be printed and exported through Collabora Online.

[IMPORTANT] 
====
"_can edit_" and "_{secure-view-label}_" are mutually exclusive. 
If "_can edit_" is enabled and a user enables "_{secure-view-label}_", then "_can edit_" is automatically disabled.
====

When "_{secure-view-label}_" is enabled, any attempts to download the file will be blocked, as exemplified in the screenshot below.
Additionally, select, copy, and paste are disabled.
