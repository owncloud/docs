== Collabora Online

{collabora-online-url}[Collabora Online] is a powerful {libreoffice-url}[LibreOffice]-based online office that supports all major document, spreadsheet and presentation file formats, and is integrable with ownCloud. 

=== Secure View

Secure View is a way to securely distribute information, without that information being able to leave your organisation.
It provides the ability to restrict access to documents, in _read-only_ shares, so that recipients cannot copy, download, or edit shared files.

When enabled, documents will be viewed through Collabora Online with a watermark.
In addition, the ability to print and export files (with watermarks) is available, once Secure View is enabled.

NOTE: This feature is *not* available in the community edition.

==== How to Use Secure View

To enable Secure View for an existing, or new, share:

* Disable btn:[can edit]; Users will only be able to view documents.
* Enable one or both of:
** btn:[protect with watermarks]: Watermarked documents can be viewed through Collabora Online.
** btn:[can print/export]: Documents can be printed or exported through Collabora Online.

When "_protect with watermarks_" is enabled, any attempts to download the file will be blocked, as exemplified in the screenshot below.
Additionally, select, copy, and paste are disabled.

[IMPORTANT] 
====
Bear in mind that "_can edit_" and "_protect with watermarks_" are mutually exclusive. 
Therefore, if "_can edit_" is enabled and a user enables "_protect with watermarks_", then "_can edit_" is automatically disabled.

NOTE: This feature is *not* available for Public Links.
