== Collabora Online

{collabora-online-url}[Collabora Online] is a powerful {libreoffice-url}[LibreOffice]-based online office that supports all major document, spreadsheet and presentation file formats, and is integrable with ownCloud. 

=== Secure View

Secure View provides the ability to restrict access to documents, in _read-only_ shares, so that users can:

. View a file with or without a custom watermark.
. Print and export a file with a custom watermark.

==== How to Use Secure View

image:collaboration/secure-view/secure-view-configuration-options.png[Configuring Secure View in ownCloud]

To enable Secure View for an existing or new share, click btn:[Secure View (with watermarks)].
When it is enabled, btn:[can print / export PDF] will become visible.

[IMPORTANT] 
====
Bear in mind that "_can edit_" and "_Secure View (with watermarks)_" are mutually exclusive. 
Therefore, if "_can edit_" is enabled and a user enables "_Secure View (with watermarks)_", then "_can edit_" is automatically disabled.
If "_Secure View (with watermarks)_" is enabled, then there is no way to download the file and Collabora will loads with SecView permissions.
