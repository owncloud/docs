== Introduction

The Admin Audit app is an auditing module for ownCloud to trace the actions of users and administrators.

== Configuration

The following configuration is required, in "config.php", to redirect audit messages into a log file.

[source,console]
----
'log.conditions' => [
  [
    'apps' => ['admin_audit'],
    // Adjust the path below, to match your setup
    'logfile' => '/var/www/owncloud/data/admin_audit.log'
  ]
]
----

Please note that the target path must be writeable for the webserver user.
All messages, regardless of log level, will be logged there.
To ignore all CLI triggered events (not the default), you can set the following option:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix}  config:app:set admin_audit ignore_cli_events --value='yes'
----

=== Grouped Logging

With each log message, several users are calculated to be the 'audit context'.
This is the list of users which are related to the log message.
Additionally, each log message includes a list of groups that the users are a member of, to enable filtering and splitting of the log messages at a later date.
In cases when users are members of many groups, to reduce the data output, the group list can be filtered using the following config option:

[source,console]
----
'admin_audit.groups' => [
  'group1',
  'group2'
]
----

When the filter is configured, only the filtered list of groups will be output in `auditGroups`, else, all groups that the `auditUsers` are a member of are output.

=== Connect with Splunk Cloud

[quote,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splunk,Wikipedia]
Splunk captures, indexes, and correlates real-time data in a searchable repository from which it can generate graphs, reports, alerts, dashboards, and visualizations.

To connect ownCloud with {splunk-cloud-url}[Splunk Cloud], you need to carry out the steps below:

. Install {splunk-universal-forwarder-url}[the _Splunk Universal Forwarder_]
+
TIP: You can find the system requirements for installing Splunk in {splunk-docs-url-system-reqs}[the Splunk documentation].
. Connect your local forwarder to your Splunk Cloud instance
You can do this by running the following command:
+ 
[source,console]
----
# Change the URL to match your setup
splunk set deploy-poll input-prd-your-server-here.cloud.splunk.com:8089
----
. Install the _Splunk Cloud_ credentials
You can do this by running the following command:
+ 
[source,console]
----
# Change the path and admin setting to match your setup
splunk install app path/to/splunkclouduf.spl -auth admin:changeme
----

. Set the ownCloud audit log to be monitored by Splunk 
You can do this by adding the following configuration to `inputs.conf`:
+
[source,console]
----
# The file, including the path, must match the 'log.conditions' setting above
[monitor://var/www/owncloud/data/admin_audit.log]
 disabled = false
 sourcetype = _json
 index = main
----

. Configure `props.conf`, as in the following configuration example, to ensure that the time field is correctly used and that the fields are extracted
+
[source,console]
----
[_json]
 INDEXED_EXTRACTIONS = json
 KV_MODE = json
 TIMESTAMP_FIELDS = [Time]
 category = Structured
----

TIP: For more details on configuring the Splunk Universal Forwarder, please refer to {splunk-universal-forwarder-docs-url}[Splunkâ€™s online documentation].

== Output

The audit app listens for internal ownCloud events and hooks and produces a rich set of audit entries useful for reporting on the usage of your ownCloud server.
Log entries are based upon the internal ownCloud logging system but contain extra fields that hold relevant data fields related to the specific event.

Each event will contain, at a minimum, the data in the following table:

[cols="15%,15%,70%", options="header",]
|===
|Setting
|Type
|Description

|`remoteAddr` 
|string 
|The remote client IP 

|`user` 
|string 
|The UID of the user performing the action. Or "IP x.x.x.x.", "cron", "CLI", "unknown" 

|`url` 
|string 
|The process request URI 

|`method` 
|string 
|The HTTP request method 

|`userAgent` 
|string 
|The HTTP request user agent 

|`time` 
|string 
|The time of the event e.g.,: 2018-05-08T08:26:00+00:00 

|`app` 
|string 
|Always 'admin_audit' 

|`message` 
|string 
|Sentence explaining the action 

|`action` 
|string 
|Unique action identifier e.g.,: file_delete or public_link_created 

|`CLI` 
|boolean 
|If the action was performed from the CLI 

|`level` 
|integer 
|The log level of the entry (usually 1 for audit events)
