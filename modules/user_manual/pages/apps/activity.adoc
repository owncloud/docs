= The Activity App
:toc: right

== Introduction

The ownCloud Activity app gathers all your file or folder related actions in one place for you to review and can notify you about them via email as well. 
You can decide, in detail, which file and folder actions are listed in the Activity stream, and for which file or folder actions to receive email notifications. 
By using the app, you can ensure that you never miss an important event related to content in ownCloud and always be up-to-date on all activities of your files and folders.

[TIP] 
====
The Activity App is shipped and enabled by default. 
If it is not enabled, contact your ownCloud administrator to have it enabled.

== Viewing Notifications

To view notifications, click the hamburger menu, in the top left-hand corner of the WebUI, and then click "_Activity_", as you can see in the screenshot below.

By default, you see all activity related to your files and folders.
However, by using the left-hand navigation menu, you can filter activity by:

* Activities by you
* Activities by others
* Favorites
* Comments
* Shares

== Configuring the Activity App

To configure your Activity preferences navigate to menu:Settings[Personal > General > Activity]. 
You can configure notifications for when:

* Files and folders are created, changed, deleted, restored (from the trash bin), and shared.
* Files and folders are shared from another server.
* A publicly shared file or folder was downloaded.
* Comments are added to a file.
* System tags for a file have been modified.

To do so, enable or disable the relevant checkboxes in the Activity settings panel, as in the screenshot below.

TIP: Sharing actions are only visible to the sharer and recipient.

=== Limiting Notifications

For users with lots of activity, it is possible to limit the Activity stream to 'Favorites' to avoid noise.

=== Configuring the Email Notification Interval

In addition to enabling and disabling email notifications, bulk email notifications can be configured to be sent out: _As soon as possible_ (during the next cron execution), _Hourly_, _Daily_, and _Weekly_.
To do so, pick the interval in the "_Send emails:_" drop-down field at the bottom of the Activity configuration panel.
