=== Changing Your Profile Picture

There are two options to set your profile picture:

* You can upload an image; or 
* Select an existing profile picture

==== Upload a Profile Picture

To upload an image click the "_Upload new_" image:personal-settings/general/upload-profile-picture.png[] button, which opens a file browser, through which you can choose an image to upload.
After you’ve chosen an image, you will then be able to crop the uploaded image, if required, to just the segment of the image that you want to use for your profile picture.
You can see an example in the screenshot below.

.Crop the new profile picture

TIP: the image can be a maximum of 20MB in size.

==== Select a Profile Picture

To select a profile picture, click the _Select from Files_ image:personal-settings/general/choose-profile-picture-button.png[] button and the profile picture chooser will open. 
From there, pick the profile picture that you want and click btn:[Choose].
