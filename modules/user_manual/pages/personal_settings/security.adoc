== Introduction

The security settings page allows for:

* Managing Two-Factor Authentication (if enabled by the administrator)
* Managing CORS white-listed domains
* Viewing and deleting user sessions
* Creating new app passcodes

== Settings

=== Two-Factor Authentication

Two-Factor Authentication appears only if enabled by the administrator. It is never enabled by default and as a user you can opt-in and also stop this kind of additional security measure. When enabled and set up, you have to enter, in addition to your password, a second factor which is a time-based one-time password (TOTP) provided via another device during the web login. This device can be a mobile phone or another device providing the second factor, e.g. via an app or SMS.

In the setup example below, an app on the mobile phone will be used to provide the second factor. For your convenience, some example apps are listed: 

iOS App Store::
{ios-ms-auth-url}[Microsoft Authenticator] +
{ios-2fas-url}[2FA Authenticator (2FAS)]

Google Play Store::
{gps-ms-auth-url}[Microsoft Authenticator] +
{gps-google-auth-url}[Google Authenticator] +
{gps-2fas-url}[2FA Authenticator (2FAS)]

.Enable Two-Factor Authentication

After enabling Two-Factor Authentication via the btn:[Activate TOPT] check mark, the image changes and you can proceed with finalizing the setup.

.Activated Two-Factor Authentication

To finalize the setup, follow the app's directions to scan the QR code. The number displayed (2nd factor) needs to be entered in the browser dialog in the btn:[Authentication code] field.

Log out and after your next regular login with user name and password, you will be asked to enter the number that the app provides. The number changes after some time and usually a counter is shown how much time is remaining after the next number appears.

==== Disable Two-Factor Authentication

You can disable the two-factor authentication at any time by unchecking btn:[Activate TOPT]

==== Lost or Defect Device

If the device providing the second factor gets lost or is defect, the administrator can temporarily disable the two-factor authentication for the account in question. A login can then be made without providing the second factor. If the issue is solved, the administrator can re-enable two-factor authentication.

=== CORS White-listed Domains

.CORS (Cross-origin Resource Sharing) configuration section
image::personal-settings/security/cors-section.png[]

The {cors-url}[CORS (Cross-origin resource sharing)] white-listed domains section lists zero or more domains which the ownCloud instance is allowed to request resources from, in addition to the current domain, for your user account.

By default, as in the screenshot above, no domains will be listed.
If you want to add one, or more, add them, one at a time, in the Domain text field, and click btn:[Add].
You will then see them listed, as in the screenshot below. 

[IMPORTANT] 
.Valid records:
====
[width="70%",cols="45%,60%",options="header"]
|===
| Record Scheme            | Example
| protocol + domain        | \https://example.com 
| protocol + domain + port | \https://example.com:80
| protocol + ip            | \http://127.0.0.1 
| protocol + ip + port     | \http://127.0.0.1:8080 
|===

_CORS entries follow strict rules, only *http* and *https* protocols are allowed._ 
====

To remove one, or more, click the trashbin icon next to the relevant domain name.

.CORS Configuration Section with white-listed domains

You will then be prompted to confirm if you want to remove the domain.
If you do, click btn:[Yes].
If you do not, click btn:[No].

=== Sessions

.Sessions section
image::personal-settings/security/sessions-section.png[]

The sessions section, which you can see an example of below, lists all your current user sessions, across web, desktop, and mobile clients.
Specifically, it lists the browser user agent string and the time of the most recent activity.
If you want to log a session out, then click the Disconnect button at the far right of the relevant session.

=== App Passwords / Tokens

.App password / tokens section
image::personal-settings/security/app-password-tokens-section.png[]

This section lets you give an app or device permissions to access your ownCloud account.
App passwords are a security measure which let you hide your actual password.
To create one, insert the app name in the text field and click btn:[Create new app passcode].

.Create new app password / token
image::personal-settings/security/create-new-app-password-token.png[]

As you can see in the screenshot above, a username and password/token will be generated, and the app will be listed in the apps list in this section. 

IMPORTANT: Make sure you either securely store the username and password / token or ensure that the receiver does, because once you click btn:[Done] the username and password / token will longer be discoverable.

If you want to revoke access for a device or app, click the trash bin icon next to its name in the apps list. 

IMPORTANT: No confirmation of revocation is requested. 
Once you click the trash bin icon, the apps access is revoked.
