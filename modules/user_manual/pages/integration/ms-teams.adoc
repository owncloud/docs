= Integrate ownCloud into Microsoft Teams
:toc: right

== Introduction

You can access your ownCloud via Microsoft Teams if your administrator has created an app available in your organization's app catalog. It is possible that the admin already has enabled the app for the users, in this case you do not need to search for it in your organization's app catalog as it is already pinned.

== Access the App

To access the app, perform the following steps:

. Log in to Teams.

. Click on the overflow menu, select Apps and search for *ownCloud for Teams* or the name provided by your admin.

. Log in to ownCloud by clicking on *Login to ownCloud with Azure AD*.

. For security reasons, you need to repeat the login process after a certain idle time.

. Repeat the steps if there is more than one ownCloud for Teams app available accessing different ownCloud hosts.
