== Which Files Are Never Encrypted

Only the *data* in the files in `data/<user>/files`,  and external storages (_if enabled_), is encrypted, _not_ the filenames or folder structures.
The following files are *never* encrypted:

* Existing files in the trash bin & Versions.
  Only new and changed files after encryption is enabled are encrypted.
+
NOTE: You can post encrypt existing files via an xref:admin_manual:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#encryption[occ encryption command].
* Existing files in Version
* Image thumbnails
* Previews from the Files app.
* The search index from the full text search app.
* Third-party app data

There may be other files that are not encrypted.

NOTE: Only files that are exposed to third-party storage providers are guaranteed to be encrypted.
