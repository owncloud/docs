= Configuring External Storage

The External Storage application allows you to mount external storage
services, such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Amazon S3, SMB/CIFS
fileservers, and FTP servers in ownCloud. Your ownCloud server
administrator controls which of these are available to you. Please see
xref:admin_manual:configuration/files/external_storage/configuration.adoc[External Storage Configuration] in the ownCloud
Administrator’s manual for configuration howtos and examples.
