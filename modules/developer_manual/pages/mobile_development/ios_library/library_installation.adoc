= Library Installation

== Obtaining the library

The ownCloud iOS library may be obtained from the following Github
repository:

mailto:git@github.com:owncloud/ios-library.git[git@github.com:owncloud/ios-library.git]

Once obtained, this code should be compiled with Xcode 6. The Github
repository not only contains the library, ownCloud iOS library, but also
contains a sample project, OCLibraryExample, which will assist in
learning how to use the library.

== Add the library to a project

There are two methods to add this library to a project.

* Reference the headers and library binary file (`.a`) directly.
* Include the library as a subproject.

Which method to choose depends on user preference as well as whether the
source code and project file of the static library are available.

=== Reference headers and library binary files

Follow these steps if this is the desired method.

1. Compile the ownCloud iOS library and run the project. A `libownCloudiOS.a` file will be generated.

The following files are required:

*Library file*

* `libownCloudiOS.a` (Library)

*Library Classes*

* `OCCommunication.h` (Accessors) Import in the communication class
* `OCErrorMsg.h` (Error Messages) Import in the communication class
* `OCFileDto.h` and `OCFileDto.m` (File/Folder object) Import when using
* `readFolder` and `readFile` methods
* `OCFrameworkConstants.h` (Customize constants)

[start=2]
. Add the library file to the project. From the `Build Phases` tab, scroll to `Link binary files` and select the `+` to add a library.
Select the library file.

[start=3]
. Add the path of the library header files. Under the `Build
Settings` tab, select the target library and add the path in the
`Header Search Paths` field.

[start=4]
. Remaining in the `Build Setting` tab, add the flag `-Obj-C` under the `Other Linker Flags` option.

At this stage, the library is included on your project and you can start
communicating with the ownCloud server.

=== Include the library as a subproject

Follow these steps if this is the desired method.

[start=5]
. Add the file `ownCloud iOS library.xcodeproj` to the project via drag and drop.

[start=6]
. Within the project, navigate to the `Build Phases` tab. Under the
`Target Dependencies` section, select the `+' and choose the library target.

[start=7]
. Link the library file to the project target. Under the `Build
Phases` tab, select the `+' under the `Link Binary with Libraries` section and select the library file.

[start=8]
. Add the flag `-Obj-C` to `Other Linker Flags` under the project target on the `Build Settings` tab.

[start=9]
. Finally add the path of the library headers. Under the `Build
Settings` tab, add the path under the `Header Search Paths` option.
