Docker containers reduce the complexity of creating development environments. 
By using them, as a developer, you won't have to care too much about server administration, e.g., MySQL, Redis or Apache, as it is largely handled by container orchestration.

In this guide, you will learn how to setup an ownCloud development environment, using Docker.
//The environment is described in a `docker-compose.yml` file.
To be able to do so, you need to follow these steps:

. xref:get-the-owncloud-source[Get the ownCloud source]
. xref:create-the-environment-with-docker-compose[Create the environment with docker-compose]
. xref:build-the-container[Build the container]
. xref:install-the-software-dependencies[Install the software dependencies]
. xref:enable-debug-mode[Enable debug mode]
. xref:setup-owncloud[Setup ownCloud]

== Prerequisite

This guide assumes that you already have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed on your computer.
If you do not, {docker-download-url}[download the version for your operating system] and install it.

== Get the Source

First, get the ownCloud source code, either by {owncloud-server-tarball-url}[downloading a tarball] or by {owncloud-core-repo-url}[cloning the source], and place it in a folder inside your home directory; for example: `/home/<your-username>/src/owncloud`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Be aware that the ownCloud git repository contains a very raw version of ownCloud.
It must be enriched with some other apps inside the `owncloud/apps` folder. 
It is possible to clone some different apps to that location.
The `user_management` app for example.
====

== Create the Development Environment with docker-compose

With the ownCloud source available, you can create a Docker-based development environment.
To save time, we'll use {owncloud-docker-compose-url}[ownCloud's `docker-compose.yml` file].
It is designed to create a very simple production environment, so it requires some modifications.

TIP: See {docker-compose-file-reference-url}[the Docker Compose file reference] to learn all about the [docker-compose.yml] file format.

Download it to the root of the directory where you put the ownCloud source.
After you download it, change the container image that is used within the ownCloud service to `owncloudci/base:latest`, as in the example below.

[source,yml]
....
services:
  owncloud:
    image: owncloudci/base:latest
....

Next, the downloaded/cloned ownCloud source folder must be mounted into the container. 
To do so, add an entry to the `volumes` section, inside the ownCloud service configuration, as in the example below.

[source,yml]
....
services:
  owncloud:
    image: owncloud/oc_dev:latest
    ...
    volumes:
      - <owncloud_source_directory>:/var/www/owncloud
      ... other volumes configuration
....

With those two changes made, start the Docker environment by running `docker-compose up -d --build`.

NOTE: This does not install ownCloud, only starts the Docker container.

TIP: If this is your first time either running `docker-compose up` or using the `owncloud/oc_dev` container, it may take a few minutes to complete, as the container needs to be downloaded.

== Build the Container

With the container running, ownCloud needs to be installed, by running the `make` command from inside the container. 
To do this, we first need to attach (log in) to the container.
To do that, we need the running container's name.
You find that by running `docker-compose ps`, which will render output similar to that below in the console:

[source,console]
....
              Name                 Command               State                  Ports
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
oc_dev_docker_oc_dev_1           apache                  Up               80/tcp
....

Take note of the value in the `Name` column, i.e., `oc_dev_docker_oc_dev_1`.
This string is a combination of three things, separated by underscores:

. The directory in which you ran `docker-compose up` (`oc_dev_docker`)
. The name of the container (`oc_dev`)
. The container's auto-generated number (`1`)

To log in to the running container, replace `<container_name>` in the command below with the name of the container in the output from `docker-compose ps`.

[source,console]
....
docker-compose exec <container_name> /bin/bash
....

After logging in, run `make`.
When the command completes, test that you can access ownCloud in your browser by opening `http://localhost`.

TIP: You can also use xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc[the `occ` command] within the container, just as if you were on a production server.

== Enable Debug Mode

Now that ownCloud's available, we strongly encourage you to disable JavaScript and CSS caching during development. 
This ensures that changes immediately visible, not later, when the respective caches expire. 
To disable JavaScript and CSS caching, enable debug mode by setting `debug` to `true` in `config/config.php`, as in the example below.

[source,php]
----
<?php

$CONFIG = [
    'debug' => true,
    ... remaining configuration goes here ...
];
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not enable this for production! 
This can create security problems and is only meant for debugging and development!
====

== Setup ownCloud

With the steps completed, you're now ready to use either xref:admin_manual:installation/installation_wizard.adoc[the ownCloud installation wizard] or xref:admin_manual:installation/command_line_installation.adoc[the command line installer] to finish setting up ownCloud.
