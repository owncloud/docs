== Database Access

The basic way to run a database query is to use the database connection provided by `OCP\\IDBConnection`. 
Inside your database layer class you can now start running queries like:

[source,php]

include::{examplesdir}app/fundamentals/database/database-access.php[]
----

== Database Programming Guidelines

* Always use the Query Builder.
* Don't update more than 1 million rows within a transaction due to DB limitations.
* Don't add more than 999 conditions in a `WHERE ... IN ...` statement but chunk it into separate queries when using SQLite.
* When processing big tables, always do this in chunks, don't store the whole table in memory.
* Oracle compatibility specifics:
** For Oracle, `null` and empty strings are the same thing. Special handling is required to catch these cases.
** When reading values, make sure to convert nulls to empty strings when expected.
** When using a condition based on empty strings, use `is not null` with Oracle instead.
** Oracle can only compare the first 4000 bytes of a `CLOB` column.
** Make sure to properly escape column names when using custom functions with `createFunction`. The escaping is usually done automatically by the query builder. Oracle is the most likely to complain about unquoted columns while other databases will work fine.
** Always add the table name when calling `lastInsertId($tableName)`, as it is required by Oracle to return correct values.
* In general, don't specify a value for an `autoincrement` column. If you have to, keep in mind that Oracle's `autoincrement` trigger will get in the way on `INSERT`. As a result, you'll need a subsequent `UPDATE` to properly adjust the value.
* *Always* make sure there are unit tests for the database operations with queries to verify the result. This will help find out whether the database related code works on all databases and often times might reveal database quirks.
* Running unit tests with specific databases:  `make test-php TEST_PHP_SUITE=path/to/test/file.php TEST_DATABASE=$databasetype` where "$databasetype" is one of "sqlite", "mysql", "mariadb", "pgsql", "oci" and "mysqlmb4".
* String concatenation should be done like this:
** `CONCAT(str1, str2, ... strN)` for MYSQL.
** `str1 || str1 ... || strN` SQLite/pgSQL/Oracle.
* Use `IQueryBuilder::createPositionalParameter` instead of `IQueryBuilder::createNamedParameter` when using `like()`.

== Mappers

The aforementioned example is the most basic way to write a simple database query but the more queries amass, the more code has to be written and the harder it will become to maintain it.

To generalize and simplify the problem, split code into resources and create an `Entity` and a `Mapper` class for it. 
The mapper class provides a way to run SQL queries and maps the result onto the related entities.

To create a mapper, inherit from the mapper baseclass and call the parent constructor with the following parameters:

* Database connection
* Table name
* *Optional*: Entity class name, defaults to `\\OCA\\MyApp\\Db\\Author`
in the example below

[source,php]
----
include::{examplesdir}app/fundamentals/database/authormapper.php[]
----

The cursor is closed automatically for all *INSERT*, *DELETE*, *UPDATE* queries and when calling the methods *findOneQuery*, *findEntities*, *findEntity*, *delete*, *insert* and *update*. 
For custom calls using execute you should always close the cursor after you are done with the fetching to prevent database lock problems on SqLite

Every mapper also implements default methods for deleting and updating an entity based on its id:

----
$authorMapper->delete($entity);
----

or:

----
$authorMapper->update($entity);
----

== Entities

Entities are data objects that carry all the table’s information for one row. 
Every Entity has an `id` field by default that is set to the integer type. 
Table rows are mapped from lower case and underscore separated names to pascal case attributes:

* *Table column name*: phone_number
* *Property name*: phoneNumber

[source,php]
----
include::{examplesdir}app/fundamentals/database/author.php[]
----

== Types

The following properties should be annotated by types, to not only assure that the types are converted correctly for storing them in the database (e.g., PHP casts false to the empty string which fails on PostgreSQL) but also for casting them when they are retrieved from the database.

The following types can be added for a field:

* integer
* float
* boolean

== Accessing attributes

Since all attributes should be protected, getters and setters are automatically generated for you:

[source,php]
----
include::{examplesdir}app/fundamentals/database/author-access-attributes.php[]
----

== Custom Attribute to Database Column Mapping

By default each attribute will be mapped to a database column by a certain convention, e.g. `phoneNumber` will be mapped to the column `phone_number` and vice versa. 
Sometimes it is needed though to map attributes to different columns because of backwards compatibility. 
To define a custom mapping, simply override the `columnToProperty` and `propertyToColumn` methods of the entity in question:

[source,php]
----
include::{examplesdir}app/fundamentals/database/custom-attribute-to-database-column-mapping.php[]
----

== Slugs

Slugs are used to identify resources in the URL by a string rather than integer id. 
Since the URL allows only certain values, the entity `baseclass` provides a `slugify` method for it:

[source,php]
----
include::{examplesdir}app/fundamentals/database/slug.php[]
----

== Database Migrations

ownCloud uses migration steps to perform changes between releases. 
In most cases, these changes relate to the core database schema. 
However, other types of changes may be required. 
Therefore we support three kinds of migration steps, these are:

* *Simple:* run general migration steps. 
  These are quite similar to the xref:app/fundamentals/info.adoc#repair-steps[migration repair steps].
* *SQL:* create a list of executable SQL commands.
* *Schema:* migration via schema migration operations.

Starting with ownCloud 10, this is the preferred way to perform any kind of migrations and is enabled by default within core. 
Any app which wants to use this mechanism has to enable it in appinfo/info.xml, by adding the following:

[source,xml]
----
<use-migrations>true</use-migrations>
----

IMPORTANT: If migrations are enabled then appinfo/database.xml is ignored. 
From this point onwards, when an app is installed or upgraded, all outstanding migrations are executed. 
Below is a migration code sample for creating an application’s core table.

[source,php]
----
include::{examplesdir}app/fundamentals/database/migrations.php[]
----

You can see examples of how to create the three migration types in the next section.

It is still necessary to increment the application’s version number to trigger the execution of migrations.

=== How to Create a Migration

1.  Enable migrations by adding the XML tag to appinfo/info.xml

[source,xml]
----
<use-migrations>true</use-migrations>
----

1.  Create a migration step

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} migrations:generate app-name {simple, SQL, schema}
----

=== A Simple Migration Step

The simple migration step skeleton looks like this:

[source,php]
----
include::{examplesdir}app/fundamentals/database/create-migration-step.php[]
----

=== A SQL Migration Step

A SQL migration step skeleton looks like this:

[source,php]
----
include::{examplesdir}app/fundamentals/database/sql-migration-step.php[]
----

Within the `sql()` method you can generate any number of SQL commands.
The generated commands will be returned as an array, and the statements will be executed afterward.

Please do not execute any generated SQL statements directly on the database.

The parameter `$connection` can be used to retrieve a database platform object or to test if tables exist. 
In order to create cross-compatible SQL code, please use the platform object or generate SQL commands for each supported database system.

=== A Schema Migration Step

A schema migration step skeleton looks like this:

[source,php]
----
include::{examplesdir}app/fundamentals/database/schema-migration-step.php[]
----

Within the `changeSchema()` method, you can use the {dbal-class-schema-url}[Class Schema] to manipulate the existing database schema.
This is the preferred way to manipulate the schema.

1.  Test your migration step

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} migrations:execute dav 20161130090952
----

Because all migration steps will be executed upon installation, there is no explicit need for unit tests.

1.  Deploy the migration(s)

To trigger the migrations, the app version has to be increased. 
Doing so applies all steps which have not yet been executed.

== How to Update the Database Schema

TIP: The recommended method for updating the database is to use xref:database-migrations[migrations].

ownCloud uses a database abstraction layer on top of {php-net-url}/manual/en/book.pdo.php[PDO], depending on its availability on the server. The database schema is contained in `appinfo/database.xml`, and uses MDB2’s {xml-scheme-notation-url}[XML scheme notation]. The placeholders `dbprefix` (*PREFIX* in your SQL) and `dbname` can be used for the configured database table prefix and database name.

An example database XML file would look like this:

[source,xml]
----
include::{examplesdir}app/fundamentals/database/schema-update.xml[]
----

To update the tables used by the app: adjust the `database.xml` file to reflect the changes which you want to make. 
Then, increment the app version number in appinfo/info.xml to trigger an update.
