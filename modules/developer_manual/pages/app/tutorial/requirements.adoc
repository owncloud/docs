= Minimum Requirements

Before you can develop ownCloud applications, as with developing other
software applications, you have to ensure that you have a working
development environment.

To do that:

* First, ensure that your development environment meets the minimum
requirements
* Then, create the core files that any ownCloud application needs

There aren’t many; all that you’ll need is:

* PHP, with a minimum version {minimum-php-version} (though preferably {recommended-php-version})
* A copy of ownCloud core
* A working installation of ownCloud server

To find out more, read through xref:general/devenv.adoc[the Development Environment section]. 
When you've done everything that it suggests, you’re ready to begin developing an ownCloud application.
