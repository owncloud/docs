== PHP Unit Tests

ownCloud uses PHPUnit >= 7.5 for unit testing PHP code.

=== Getting PHPUnit

Running `make` in your terminal from the `webroot` directory will prepare
everything for testing. This will install beside necessary dependencies,
a local version of PHPUnit at `<webroot>/lib/composer/phpunit/phpunit`.

* Run `make help` to get a list of parameters
* To update your testing environment run `make clean` and `make` again.
* Take care that the php phpunit file in the path provided has the executable permission set.

=== Running PHP Unit tests

There are existing test options provided by ownCloud.
To run them, change into the root directory of your ownCloud installation and run `grep "make test" <(make help)` to see tests and parameters available.

You should see output similar to the below example.

[source,console]
----
make test                   run all tests
make test-php-unit          run all PHP tests
make test-php-style         run PHP code style checks
make test-php-phan          run PHP phan static code analyzer
make test-php-phpstan       run PHP phpstan static code analyzer
make test-js                run Javascript tests
make test-js-debug          run Javascript tests in debug mode (continuous)
make test-acceptance-api    run API acceptance tests
make test-acceptance-cli    run CLI acceptance tests
make test-acceptance-webui  run webUI acceptance tests
make test-php-unit          TEST_DATABASE=mysql TEST_PHP_SUITE=path/to/testfile.php
make test-php-style-fix     run PHP code style checks and fix any issues found
----

==== Testing Apps

To run the tests for a specific app with the provided PHPUnit version:

. Change into one of the writable directories listed in the `apps_paths` array in `config/config.php`. For example:
[source,console]
----
cd apps-external
----

. Clone the app from GitHub. For example:
[source,console]
----
git clone https://github.com/owncloud/notes.git
----

. Enable the app. For example:
[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
cd ..
{occ-command-example-prefix} app:enable notes
----

. Change into the newly cloned directory. For example:
[source,console]
----
cd apps-external/notes
----

. Run the following command:
+
--
[source,console]
----
make test-php-unit
----

Here's an example of running the command in {notes-app-url}[the notes app]:

[source,console]
----
php -d zend.enable_gc=0  "/home/phil/git/owncloud/core/apps-external/notes/../../lib/composer/bin/phpunit" --configuration ./phpunit.xml --testsuite unit

[NOTE] 
====
Apps that are part of core *do not* have their own Makefile.
Third party apps are all apps that are not distributed by https://marketplace.owncloud.com/publishers/owncloud[ownCloud] or not in xref:admin_manual:installation/apps_supported.adoc[the supported apps list].
====

=== Writing PHP Unit tests

To get started, do the following:

* Create a directory called `tests/unit` in the top level of your application
* Create a PHP file in the directory and `require_once` your class which you want to test.

Then you can run the created test with `phpunit`.

TIP: Alternatively, you can use link:{attachmentsdir}/core/Makefile.example[the default Makefile] to automate your unit tests.

If you use ownCloud functions in your class under test (i.e:
OC::getUser()) you’ll need to bootstrap ownCloud or use dependency
injection.

[NOTE]
====
You'll most likely run your tests under a different user than the Web server. 
This might cause problems with your PHP settings (i.e., `open_basedir`) and requires you to adjust your configuration.
====

Given the class `MyClass` in your app:

./srv/http/owncloud/apps/myapp/tests/lib/MyClass.php
[source,php]
----
include::{examplesdir}core/unit-testing/MyClass.php[MyClass.php]
----

An example for a simple test would be:

./srv/http/owncloud/apps/myapp/tests/unit/MyClassTest.php
[source,php]
----
include::{examplesdir}core/unit-testing/MyClassTest.php[MyClassTest.php]
----

[NOTE]
====
The class under test and the test class should share the same namespace so you do not need to use a dedicated `use` statement for it. 
This is {recommended-way-to-organise-tests-url}[the recommended way to organize tests].
====

In `/srv/http/owncloud/apps/myapp/` you run the test with the following command:

[source,console]
----
phpunit tests/unit/MyClassTest.php
----

Make sure to extend the `\Test\TestCase` class with your test and always call the parent methods, when overwriting `setUp()`,
`setUpBeforeClass()`, `tearDown()` or `tearDownAfterClass()` methods from the `TestCase`.
These methods set up important stuff and clean up the system after the test so that the next test can run without side effects, such as clearing files and entries from the file cache, etc.
For more resources on writing tests for PHPUnit visit {writing-tests-url}[the writing tests section] of the PHPUnit documentation.

=== Bootstrapping ownCloud

If you use ownCloud functions or classes in your code, you’ll need to
make them available to your test by bootstrapping ownCloud.

To do this, you’ll need to provide the `--bootstrap` argument when
running PHPUnit

/srv/http/owncloud

----
phpunit --bootstrap tests/bootstrap.php apps/myapp/tests/testsuite.php
----

If you run the test suite as a user other than your Web server, you'll
have to adjust your php.ini and file rights.

/etc/php/php.ini

----
open_basedir = none
----

/srv/http/owncloud:

----
su -c "chmod a+r config/config.php"
su -c "chmod a+rx data/"
su -c "chmod a+w data/owncloud.log"
----

=== Running Unit Tests for ownCloud Core

The core project provides a script that runs all the core unit tests
using the specified database backend like `sqlite`, `mysql`, `pgsql`,
`oci` (for Oracle), the default is `sqlite`

To run tests on `mysql` or `pgsql` you need a database user called
`oc_autotest` with the password `owncloud`. This user needs the
privilege to create and delete the database called `oc_autotest`.

==== MySQL Setup

----
CREATE DATABASE oc_autotest;
CREATE USER 'oc_autotest'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'owncloud';
GRANT ALL ON oc_autotest.* TO 'oc_autotest'@'localhost';
----

For parallel executor support with EXECUTOR_NUMBER=0
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

----
CREATE DATABASE oc_autotest0;
CREATE USER 'oc_autotest0'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'owncloud';
GRANT ALL ON oc_autotest0.* TO 'oc_autotest0'@'localhost';
----

==== PostgreSQL Setup

----
su - postgres

# Use password "owncloud"
createuser -P oc_autotest

# Give the user the privilege to create databases
psql -c 'ALTER USER oc_autotest CREATEDB;'
----

To enable `dropdb` add `local all all trust` to `pg_hba.conf`.

For parallel executor support with EXECUTOR_NUMBER=0
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

----
su - postgres

# Use password "owncloud"
createuser -P oc_autotest0

# Give the user the privilege to create databases
psql -c 'ALTER USER oc_autotest0 CREATEDB;'
----

==== Run Tests

To run all tests, run the following command:

----
make test-php-unit
----

To run tests only for MySQL, run the following command:

----
make test-php-unit TEST_DATABASE=mysql
----

To run a particular test suite, use the following command as a guide:

----
make test-php-unit TEST_DATABASE=mysql TEST_PHP_SUITE=tests/lib/share/share.php
----

By default, a code coverage report is generated after the test run. To
avoid the time taken for that, specify `NOCOVERAGE`:

----
make test-php-unit NOCOVERAGE=true TEST_DATABASE=mysql TEST_PHP_SUITE=tests/lib/share/share.php
----

== Unit Testing JavaScript in Core

JavaScript Unit testing for *core* and *core apps* is done using the
http://karma-runner.github.io[Karma] test runner with
https://jasmine.github.io[Jasmine].

=== Installing Node JS

To run the JavaScript unit tests you will need to install *Node JS*. You
can get it here: http://nodejs.org/ After that you will need to setup
the *Karma* test environment. The easiest way to do this is to run the
automatic test script first, see next section.

=== Running All The Tests

To run all JavaScript tests, run the following command:

----
make test-js
----

This will also automatically set up your test environment.

=== Debugging Tests in the Browser

To debug tests in the browser, this will run *Karma* in browser mode

----
make test-js-debug
----

From there, open the URL `\http://localhost:9876` in a web browser. On that
page, click on the btn:[Debug] button. An empty page will appear, from
which you must open the browser console (F12 in Firefox/Chrome). Every
time you reload the page, the unit tests will be relaunched and will
output the results in the browser console.

=== Unit Test File Paths

JavaScript unit test examples can be found in `apps/files/tests/js/`. +
Unit tests for the core app JavaScript code can be found in `core/js/tests/specs`.

=== Documentation

Here are some useful links about how to write unit tests with Jasmine and Sinon:

* Karma test runner: http://karma-runner.github.io
* Jasmine: https://jasmine.github.io
* Sinon (for mocking and stubbing): http://sinonjs.org/
