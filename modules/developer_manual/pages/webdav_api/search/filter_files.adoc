The `filter-files` report allows for retrieving a list of files in an ownCloud user's filesystem, based on two criteria:

include::{partialsdir}/webdav_api/core_request_details.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

== The Request

An authenticated https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3253#section-3.6[REPORT request] needs to be made to retrieve a list of all files stored in a user's ownCloud filesystem.

=== Example Request

[source,console]
----
curl --silent \
  -X REPORT \
  --data "@filter-files-criteria.xml" \
  -u admin:admin \
  'http://localhost/remote.php/dav/files/admin' | xmllint --format -
----

The request must include a request body that includes the rules to filter by.
There are two filter rules which can be supplied; these are:

[cols="1,2,1,1,1",options="header",]
|===
|Rule
|Description
|Type
|Accepted Values
|Mandatory

|`favorite`
|Whether theyâ€™ve been marked as a favorite or not (mandatory)
|integer
|`0`,`1`
|Yes

|`systemtag`
|The tags that have been assigned to them
|integer
|Any valid system tag. 
 These can be retrieved by using xref:webdav_api/tags.adoc#list-tags[the Tags API].
|No
|===

=== Example Request Bodies

Below, are several examples of the XML response bodies that can be sent with the request.

==== Minimal Request Body

In the `search` element, it specifies the search pattern to filter down the list of files to return in a successful resultset.

----

==== Limiting Returned File Properties

If only a specific list of properties is required for each file, then a `prop` element needs to be included in the response body, such as in the example below.

include::{partialsdir}/webdav_api/search/file_properties.adoc[]

[source,xml]
----
include::{examplesdir}core/webdav_api/search/request/filter_files/search_body_requesting_all_properties.xml[indent=0]
----

==== Filtering By Tag

Files can be filtered by those assigned specific tags.
If this is required, then the `systemtag` element needs to be supplied, which contains a space-separated list of tag _ids_ to filter by.

TIP: Tag ids can be retrieved by using xref:webdav_api/tags.adoc#list-tags[the Tags API].

[source,xml]
----
include::{examplesdir}core/webdav_api/search/request/filter_files/search_body_filtering_by_system_tag_ids.xml[indent=0]
----

NOTE: The example uses http://xmlsoft.org/xmllint.html[xmllint] to make the response more readable.
Xmllint is available in the http://www.xmlsoft.org/[libxml2 package].

== The Response

=== Success

Successful requests return two things:

. An XML payload.
. A status of `HTTP/1.1 207 Multi-Status`.

You can see an example of the XML payload below.
The XML payload contains a `response` element for each file.
And each `response` element contains three items:

. A link to the file (`href`).
. The requested properties, along with their respective values (`propstat`).
. The file's status (`status`).
