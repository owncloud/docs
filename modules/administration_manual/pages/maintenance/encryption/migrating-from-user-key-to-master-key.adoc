= Migrating User Key-based Encryption to Master Key-based Encryption

== Why Should I Move Away From User Key-based Encryption?

NOTE: User key-based encryption is planned to be removed from ownCloud in the near future. While it is a bit more secure than a central encryption approach, User key-based encryption has some disadvantages. It blocks some additional functions such as the integration of an online editor like LibreOffice or OnlyOffice into ownCloud and can cause problems when sharing files with groups. Therefore Master-key-based encryption is now the recommended setup for all new insallations.

The decryption workflow described here works for both MySQL/MariaDB and SQLite based databases. It will only work when users have enabled the password recovery. Moreover, an admin recovery password needs to be activated and available for the ownCloud administrator.

If you need to migrate from User Key-based to Master Key-based encryption, there are several steps that you need to follow to ensure a smooth and complete transition:

. xref:disable-user-key-based-encryption[Disable User Key-based encryption]
. xref:remove-the-encryption-records-from-the-owncloud-database[Remove the encryption records from the ownCloud database]
. xref:remove-the-files_encryption-directory[Remove the `files_encryption` directory]
. xref:encrypt-the-filesystem-using-master-key-based-encryption[Encrypt the filesystem using Master Key-based encryption]


== Disable User Key-based Encryption

The first part of the migration process is to decrypt all files and to disable encryption in ownCloud, which requires three commands to be executed.
These commands are: xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#encryption[`occ encryption:decrypt-all` and `occ encryption:disable`], and xref::configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#apps-commands[`occ app:disable`].

You can see an example of calling the commands listed below, configured to require no user interaction.

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} encryption:decrypt-all --continue=yes && \
{occ-command-example-prefix} encryption:disable --no-interaction && \
{occ-command-example-prefix} app:disable --no-interaction encryption
----

NOTE: The decryption of the files by the ownCloud system administrator requires the current passwords of all users!


== Remove the Encryption Records from the ownCloud Database

Once your ownCloud files are unencrypted, and encryption has been disabled, you need to remove the encryption records from the database.
There is, currently, no `occ` command to handle this, so it has to be done manually.
Specifically, you need to remove all records from the `oc_appconfig` table where the `appid` column is set to `encryption`.

In the examples below you can see how to do this using the SQLite or MySQL/MariaDB database.

[NOTE]
====
The example code for SQLite assumes that the path to the SQLite database is `<YOUR/OWNCLOUD/ROOT/DIRECTORY>data/owncloud.database`.
====

[source,console]
----
sqlite3 data/owncloud.database
sqlite> delete from oc_appconfig where appid='encryption';
sqlite> select * from oc_appconfig where appid='encryption';
----

Same for MySQL/MariaDB:

----
SELECT * FROM `oc_appconfig` WHERE `appid` LIKE 'encryption'
----


== Remove the `files_encryption` Directory

With the database updated, next, the `files_encryption` directory needs to be removed.
Below is an example of how to do so, to save you time.

[source,console]
----
find ./data* -name files_encryption -exec rm -rvf {} \;
----

== Encrypt the Filesystem Using Master Key-based Encryption

Now, your ownCloud files can be encrypted using Master Key-based encryption.
This requires the following steps:

. The encryption app needs to be enabled
. Encryption needs to be enabled
. The encryption type needs to be set to master key
. The ownCloud filesystem can be re-encrypted.

The following example shows how to do this.

[source,console]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} app:enable encryption && \
{occ-command-example-prefix} encryption:enable && \
{occ-command-example-prefix} encryption:select-encryption-type masterkey -y && \
{occ-command-example-prefix} encryption:encrypt-all && \
----


== Verify the Encrypted Files

With the files encrypted using Master Key-based encryption, you should now verify that everything worked properly.
To do so, run a `SELECT` query in your database which returns all files from the `oc_appconfig` table where the `appid` column is set to `encryption`.
You should see a number of records, as in the output of the example below.

[source,console]
----
$ sqlite3 data/owncloud.database
sqlite> select * from oc_appconfig where appid='encryption';
encryption|recoveryKeyId|recoveryKey_73facda6
encryption|publicShareKeyId|pubShare_73facda6
encryption|masterKeyId|master_73facda6
encryption|installed_version|1.3.1
encryption|types|filesystem
encryption|enabled|yes
encryption|useMasterKey|1
----

Same for MySQL/MariaDB:

[source,console]
----

select * from oc_appconfig where appid='encryption';

"encryption","enabled","yes"
"encryption","installed_version","1.4.0"
"encryption","masterKeyId","master_2c5fc438"
"encryption","publicShareKeyId","pubShare_2c5fc438"
"encryption","recoveryKeyId","recoveryKey_2c5fc438"
"encryption","types","filesystem"
"encryption","useMasterKey","1"
----
