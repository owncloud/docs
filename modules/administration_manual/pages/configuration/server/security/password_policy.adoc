== The Password Policy App

image:configuration/server/security/password-policy-app.png[The Password Policy application]

From the 2.0.0 release of https://marketplace.owncloud.com/apps/password_policy[the Password Policy app],
ownCloud administrators (both enterprise **and** community edition) have the option of installing and enabling 
the application. The Password Policy application enables administrators to define password requirements 
for user passwords and public links.

Some of policy rules apply to both user passwords and public links, and some apply to just one or the other.
The table below shows where each option can be used.

|===

NOTE: Active user sessions will **not** end when passwords expire.
However, a password change will be forced when the user session expires (e.g., on logout).
OAuth2 tokens for app or client authentication, and App passwords are not affected.

NOTE: Installing and enabling the application also extends the occ command to support
:xref:configuration/server/occ_app_command.adoc#password-policy[password policy] management.

CAUTION: After enabling the "*days until user password expires*" policy setting in the web UI,
administrators need to run the `occ user:expire-password` command to set an initial password
change date for all existing users.

== The Security App

CAUTION: Do not configure password policies using the Security and Password Policy apps simultaneously.
Please use either one or the other.
However, the brute-force protection part of the Security app can and should be used in parallel with the Password Policy app.

You can, *alternatively*, use https://marketplace.owncloud.com/apps/security[the Security app].
It supports configuring a basic password policy, which includes:

. Setting a password length
. Whether to enforce at least one upper and lower case character, a numerical character, and a special character.

TIP: In the next release, the Security app's feature-set will be reduced to provide only brute-force protection
capabilities and be renamed "*Brute-Force Protection*".
