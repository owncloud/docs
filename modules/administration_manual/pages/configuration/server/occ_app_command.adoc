= Using occ apps commands

This command reference covers the ownCloud maintained apps commands.

ownCloud’s `occ` command (ownCloud console) is ownCloud’s command-line interface. 
You can perform common server operations with `occ`, including installing and upgrading ownCloud, managing 
users and groups, encryption, passwords, and LDAP setting.

`occ` is in the owncloud/ directory; for example /var/www/owncloud on Ubuntu Linux. `occ` is a PHP script. 
*You must run it as your HTTP user* to ensure that your ownCloud files and directories retain the correct permissions.

Please ensure that the app you are going to configure is installed and enabled.

[[run-occ-as-your-http-user]]
== Run occ As Your HTTP User

The HTTP user is different on the various Linux distributions. 
See strong_perms_label to learn how to find your HTTP user.

* The HTTP user and group in Debian/Ubuntu is www-data.
* The HTTP user and group in Fedora/CentOS is apache.
* The HTTP user and group in Arch Linux is http.
* The HTTP user in openSUSE is wwwrun, and the HTTP group is www.

If your HTTP server is configured to use a different PHP version than the default (/usr/bin/php), `occ` should be run with the same version. 
For example, in CentOS 6.5 with SCL-PHP54 installed, the command looks like this:

....
sudo -u apache /opt/rh/php54/root/usr/bin/php /var/www/html/owncloud/occ
....

=== Example Commands
 
The following examples are based on Ubuntu.

Running `occ` with no options lists all commands and options

....
sudo -u www-data php occ 
ownCloud version 10.0.8

Usage:
 command [options] [arguments]
....

==== Options

-h, --help            Display this help message

Options are optional. 
Arguments can be required _or_ optional. 
The, generic, syntax is

....
occ [options] command [arguments]
....

[[usage-of-parameters-in-options]]
=== Usage of parameters in Options

In case an option requires parameters, following format should be used for short or long Options forms

The following example command has an option in `-p` (short) form and `--path` (long) form.

Parameters for long form options will be written after a blank or equal sign

....
sudo -u www-data ./occ files:scan --path="user_x/files/folder"
....

Parameters for short form options will be written either directly after the option or after a blank. Do not use the equal sign as this could be interpreted as part of the parameter.

[[ldap]]
== LDAP Integration

Marketplace URL: https://marketplace.owncloud.com/apps/user_ldap[LDAP Integration]

[source,console]
----
ldap
 ldap:check-user               Checks whether a user exists on LDAP.
 ldap:create-empty-config      Creates an empty LDAP configuration
 ldap:delete-config            Deletes an existing LDAP configuration
 ldap:search                   Executes a user or group search
 ldap:set-config               Modifies an LDAP configuration
 ldap:show-config              Shows the LDAP configuration
 ldap:test-config              Tests an LDAP configuration
 ldap:update-group             Update the specified group membership
                               Information stored locally
----

Search for an LDAP user, using this syntax:

....
sudo -u www-data php occ ldap:search [--group] [--offset="..."] [--limit="..."] search
....

Searches match at the beginning of the attribute value only.
This example searches for `givenNames` that start with 'rob':

....
sudo -u www-data php occ ldap:search "rob"
....

This will find "robbie", "roberta", and "robin".
Broaden the search to find, for example, `jeroboam` with the asterisk wildcard:

....
sudo -u www-data php occ ldap:search "*rob"
....

User search attributes are set with `ldap:set-config` (below). 
For example, if your search attributes are `givenName` and `sn` you can find users by first name + last name very quickly. 
For example, you’ll find 'Terri Hanson' by searching for `te ha`.
Trailing whitespace is ignored.

Check if an LDAP user exists. 
This works only if the ownCloud server is connected to an LDAP server.

....
sudo -u www-data php occ ldap:check-user robert
....

`ldap:check-user` will not run a check when it finds a disabled LDAP connection. 
This prevents users that exist on disabled LDAP connections from being marked as deleted. 
If you know for sure that the user you are searching for is not in one of the disabled connections, and exists on an active connection, use the `--force` option to force it to check all active LDAP connections.

....
sudo -u www-data php occ ldap:check-user --force robert
....

`ldap:create-empty-config` creates an empty LDAP configuration. 
The first one you create has no `configID`, like this example:

....
sudo -u www-data php occ ldap:create-empty-config
  Created new configuration with configID ''
....

This is a holdover from the early days, when there was no option to create additional configurations. 
The second, and all subsequent, configurations that you create are automatically assigned IDs.

....
sudo -u www-data php occ ldap:create-empty-config
   Created new configuration with configID 's01' 
....

Then you can list and view your configurations:

....
sudo -u www-data php occ ldap:show-config
....

And view the configuration for a single `configID`:

....
sudo -u www-data php occ ldap:show-config s01
....

`ldap:delete-config [configID]` deletes an existing LDAP configuration.

....
sudo -u www-data php occ ldap:delete  s01
Deleted configuration with configID 's01'
....

The `ldap:set-config` command is for manipulating configurations, like this example that sets search attributes:

....
sudo -u www-data php occ ldap:set-config s01 ldapAttributesForUserSearch 
"cn;givenname;sn;displayname;mail"
....

The command takes the following format:

....
ldap:set-config <configID> <configKey> <configValue>
....

All of the available keys, along with default values for configValue, are listed in the table below.

|===

`ldap:test-config` tests whether your configuration is correct and can bind to the server.

....
sudo -u www-data php occ ldap:test-config s01
The configuration is valid and the connection could be established!
....

`ldap:update-group` updates the specified group membership information stored locally.
The command takes the following format:

....
ldap:update-group <groupID> <groupID <groupID> ...>
....

The command allows for running a manual group sync on one or more groups, instead of having to wait 
for group syncing to occur. 
If users have been added or removed from these groups in LDAP, ownCloud will update its details. 
If a group was deleted in LDAP, ownCloud will also delete the local mapping info about this group.

New groups in LDAP won’t be synced with this command. 
The LDAP TTL configuration (by default 10 minutes) still applies. 
This means that recently deleted groups from LDAP might be considered as 
'active' and might not be deleted in ownCloud immediately.

*Configuring the LDAP Refresh Attribute Interval*

You can configure the LDAP refresh attribute interval, but not with the `ldap` commands. 
Instead, you need to use the `config:app:set` command, as in the following example, which takes a 
number of seconds to the `--value` switch.

....
sudo -u www-data php occ config:app:set user_ldap updateAttributesInterval --value=7200
....

In the example above, the interval is being set to 7200 seconds.
Assuming the above example was used, the command would output the following:

[source,console]
----
Config value updateAttributesInterval for app user_ldap set to 7200
----

If you want to reset (or unset) the setting, then you can use the following command:

....
sudo -u www-data php occ config:app:delete user_ldap updateAttributesInterval
....

[[market]]

uid and group option are discarded if the option is provided by user.
| `-u [UID]` +
`--uid=[UID]`     | The user’s uid is used. +
This option can be used as `–uid Alice –uid Bob`.
| `-g [GROUP]` +
`--group=[GROUP]` | Add password expiry to user(s) under group(s). +
This option can be used as –group `foo` –group `bar` to add expiry passwords for users 
in group foo and bar. If uid option (eg: –uid `user1`) is passed with group, 
then uid will also be processed.
|===

If an expiry date is not supplied, the password will expire with immediate effect.
This is because the password will be set as being expired 24 hours before the command was run.
For example, if the command was run at `2018-07-**12** 13:15:28 UTC`, then the password's expiry 
date will be set to `2018-07-**11** 13:15:28 UTC`.

After the command completes, console output, similar to that below, confirms when the user's password is set to expire.

....
The password for frank is set to expire on 2018-07-12 13:15:28 UTC.
....

=== Command Examples

....
# The password for user "frank" will be set as being expired 24 hours before the command was run.
sudo -u www-data php occ user:expire-password frank

# Expire the user "frank"'s password in 2 days time.
sudo -u www-data php occ user:expire-password frank '+2 days'

# Expire the user "frank"'s password on the 15th of August 2005, at 15:52:01 in the local timezone.
sudo -u www-data php occ user:expire-password frank '2005-08-15T15:52:01+00:00'

# Expire the user "frank"'s password on the 15th of August 2005, at 15:52:01 UTC.
sudo -u www-data php occ user:expire-password frank '15-Aug-05 15:52:01 UTC'
....

=== Caveats

Please be aware of the following implications of enabling or changing the password policy's "*days until 
user password expires*" option.

- Administrators need to run the `occ user:expire-password` command to initiate expiry for new users.
- Passwords will never expire for users who have *not* changed their initial password, because they do 
not have a password history. To force password expiration use the `occ user:expire-password` command.
- A password expiration date will be set after users change their password for the first time. To force 
password expiration use the `occ user:expire-password` command.
- Passwords changed for the first time, will expire based on the *active* password policy. If the policy 
is later changed, it will not update the password's expiry date to reflect the new setting.
- Password expiration dates of users where the administrator has run the `occ user:expire-password` 
command *won't* automatically update to reflect the policy change. In these cases, Administrators need 
to run the `occ user:expire-password` command again and supply a new expiry date.

[[two_factor_authentication]]
== Two-factor Authentication

Marketplace URL: https://marketplace.owncloud.com/apps/twofactor_totp[2-Factor Authentication]

If a two-factor provider app is enabled, it is enabled for all users by default (though the provider can decide whether or not the user has to pass the challenge). 
In the case of an user losing access to the second factor (e.g., a lost phone with two-factor SMS verification), the admin can temporarily disable the two-factor check for that user via the occ command:

=== Command Description

....
sudo -u www-data php occ twofactor:disable <username>
....

To re-enable two-factor authentication again, use the following command:

....
sudo -u www-data php occ twofactor:enable <username>
....
