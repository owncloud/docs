= Legal Settings Configuration

Because of one or more legal frameworks around the world, some ownCloud instances may need to have links to Imprint and Privacy Policies on all pages; both in the WebUI and within email templates.
Some of the more global legal frameworks prominent are:

- https://www.eugdpr.org/[The GDPR]
- https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy-law/privacy-act/[The Australian Privacy Act 1988]
- https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/the-personal-information-protection-and-electronic-documents-act-pipeda/[The Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Data Act (PIPEDA)]
- http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/[The California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)]
- http://www.coppa.org/[The Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA)]

ownCloud Administrators may also be required to display a legal disclosure document, both in the WebUI and within email templates.
A legal disclosure document is a legally mandated statement of the ownership and authorship of the ownCloud installation.

NOTE: You can also think of it as a rather fancy "*About Us*" page or an enhanced "*Terms and Conditions*" page.
In Germany, this is known as an "*Impressum*".

If you're required to have one or more of these, you can specify the link to
them in two ways.

== Using the Web UI

In the Web UI, under "*Settings -> Admin -> General*", under the heading "*Legal*", you can provide a link to an Imprint and a Privacy Policy URL, as you can see in the screenshot below.

NOTE: The values entered will auto-save.

== Using the Command Line

From the command line, you can use the `occ config:app:get` and `occ config:app:set` commands, as in the code sample below.

[source,console]
....
# Get the current values, if any, for the Imprint and Privacy Policy URLs
php occ config:app:get core legal.imprint_url
php occ config:app:get core legal.privacy_policy_url

# Set the Imprint and Privacy Policy URLs
php occ config:app:set core legal.imprint_url --value=new_value
php occ config:app:set core legal.privacy_policy_url --value=new_value
....

For more information about these commands, refer to xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#config-commands[the config command reference in the occ commands documentation].
