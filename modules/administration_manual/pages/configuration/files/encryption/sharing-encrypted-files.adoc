= Sharing Encrypted Files
:page-partial:

After encryption is enabled, your users must also log out and log back in to generate their personal encryption keys. 
They will see a yellow warning banner that says 

""
Encryption App is enabled, but your keys are not initialized. 
Please log-out and log-in again.
""

Also, share owners may need to re-share files after encryption is enabled. 
Users who are trying to access the share will see a message advising them to ask the share owner to re-share the file with them.

For individual shares, un-share and re-share the file. 
For group shares, share with any individuals who can't access the share. 
This updates the encryption, and then the share owner can remove the individual shares.
