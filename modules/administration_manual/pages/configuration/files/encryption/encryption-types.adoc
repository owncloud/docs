:page-partial:

ownCloud provides two encryption types:

[cols="40%,60%"]
|===
| *User-Key:*
| Every user has their own private/public key pairs, and the private key is protected by the user's password.

| *Master Key:*
| There is only one key (or key pair) and all files are encrypted using that key pair.

[IMPORTANT]
====
These encryption types are *not compatible*.
