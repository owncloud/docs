:description: With Master Key based encryption, there is only one key (or key pair) and all files are encrypted using that key pair. 

With Master Key based encryption, there is only one key (or key pair) and all files are encrypted using that key pair. 
This is highly recommended for new instances to avoid restrictions in functionality of user key encryption.

== Enabling Master Key Based Encryption

To enable Master Key based encryption requires two steps:

. xref:enable-the-encryption-app[Enable the encryption app]
. xref:enable-and-configure-master-key-based-encryption[Enable and configure User-Key based Encryption]

[TIP] 
====
We strongly encourage you to put your server in single user mode before setting up encryption.

To do so, run the following command:

....
sudo -u www-data php occ maintenance:singleuser --on
....

[[enable-and-configure-master-key-based-encryption]]
=== Enable and Configure Master Key Based Encryption

To enable and configure Master Key based encryption via the command-line, involves several commands.

. Enable encryption.
. Enable the master key.
+
NOTE: The master key mode has to be setup in a newly created instance.
. Encrypt all data.

The following example shows how to carry out these steps.

[source,console]
....
sudo -u www-data php occ encryption:enable
sudo -u www-data php occ encryption:select-encryption-type masterkey
sudo -u www-data php occ encryption:encrypt-all
....

[NOTE]
====
This command is not typically required, as the master key is often enabled at install time.
As a result, when enabling it, there should be no data to encrypt.
But, in case itâ€™s being enabled after install, and the installation does have files which are unencrypted, encrypt-all can be used to encrypt them.
====

== View Current Encryption Status

Get the current encryption status and the loaded encryption module:

[source,console]
....
sudo -u www-data php occ encryption:status
....

This is equivalent to checking Enable server-side encryption on your Admin page:

[source,console]
....
sudo -u www-data php occ encryption:enable
Encryption enabled

Default module: OC_DEFAULT_MODULE
....

[[recreating-an-existing-master-key]]
== Recreate an Existing Master Key

If the master key needs replacing, for example, because it has been compromised, an occ command is available.
The command is link:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#recreate-master-key[encryption:recreate-master-key].
It replaces existing master key with new one and encrypts the files with the new key.

== Decrypt Master-Key Based Encryption

You must first put your ownCloud server into single-user mode to prevent any user activity until encryption is completed.

[source,console]
....
sudo -u www-data php occ maintenance:singleuser --on
Single user mode is currently enabled
....

Decrypt all user data files, or optionally a single user:

[source,console]
....
sudo -u www-data php occ encryption:decrypt-all [username]
....

== Disable Encryption

To disable encryption, put your ownCloud server into single-user mode, and then disable your encryption module with these commands:

[source,console]
....
sudo -u www-data php occ maintenance:singleuser --on
sudo -u www-data php occ encryption:disable
....

Take it out of single-user mode when you are finished, by using the following command:

[source,console]
....
sudo -u www-data php occ maintenance:singleuser --off
....

[IMPORTANT]
====
You may only disable encryption by using the link:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#encryption[occ Encryption Commands].
Make sure you have backups of all encryption keys, including those for all your users.
